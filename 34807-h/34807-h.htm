  <h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

  <p class="ni"><span class="smcap">The</span> following study of the Gunpowder Plot has
  grown out of the accidental circumstance that, having undertaken to read a paper before
  the Historical Research Society, at Archbishop's House, Westminster, as the day on
  which it was to be read chanced to be the 5th of November,<a name="FN1A" id=
  "FN1A"></a><a href="#FN1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> I was asked to take the famous conspiracy
  for my subject. It was with much reluctance that I agreed to do so, believing, as I
  then did, that there was absolutely nothing fresh to say upon this topic, that no
  incident in our annals had been more thoroughly threshed out, and that in regard of
  none, so far, at least, as its broader outlines are concerned, was the truth more
  clearly established.</p>

  <p>When, however, I turned to the sources whence our knowledge of the transaction is
  derived, and in particular to the original documents upon which it is ultimately based,
  I was startled to find how grave were the doubts and difficulties which suggested
  themselves at every turn, while, though slowly and gradually, yet with ever gathering
  force, the conviction forced itself upon me, that, not merely in its details is the
  traditional story unworthy of credit, but that all the evidence points to a conclusion
  fundamentally at <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg
  vi]</a></span>variance with it. Nothing contributed so powerfully to this conviction as
  to find that every fresh line of reasoning or channel of information which could be
  discovered inevitably tended, in one way or another, towards the same result. In the
  following pages are presented to the reader the principal arguments which have wrought
  this change of view in my own mind.<sup><a name="FN2A" id="FN2A"></a><a href=
  "#FN2">[2]</a></sup></p>

  <p>I cannot pretend to furnish any full or wholly satisfactory answer to the question
  which stands upon the title-page. The real history of the Plot in all its stages we
  shall, in all probability, never know. If, however, we cannot satisfy ourselves of the
  truth, it will be much to ascertain what is false; to convince ourselves that the
  account of the matter officially supplied, and almost universally accepted, is
  obviously untrue, and that the balance of probability lies heavily against those who
  invented it, as having been the real plotters, devising and working the scheme for
  their own ends.</p>

  <p>Neither have I any wish to ignore, or to extenuate, the objections which militate
  against such a conclusion, objections arising from considerations of a general
  character, rather than from any positive evidence. Why, it may reasonably be asked, if
  the government of the day were ready to go so far as is alleged, did they not go
  further? Why, being supremely anxious to incriminate the priests, did they not
  fabricate unequivocal evidence against them, instead of satisfying themselves with what
  appears to us far from conclusive? Why did they encumber their tale with incidents,
  which, if they did not really occur, could serve <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>only to damage it, inasmuch as we, at this
  distance of time, can argue that they are impossible and absurd? How is it, moreover,
  that the absurdity was not patent to contemporaries, and was not urged by those who had
  every reason to mislike and mistrust the party in power?</p>

  <p>Considerations such as these undoubtedly deserve all attention, and must be fully
  weighed, but while they avail to establish a certain presumption in favour of the
  official story, I cannot but think that the sum of probabilities tells strongly the
  other way. It must be remembered that three centuries ago the intrinsic likelihood or
  unlikelihood of a tale did not go for much, and the accounts of plots in particular
  appear to have obtained general credence in proportion as they were incredible, as the
  case of Squires a few years earlier, and of Titus Oates somewhat later, sufficiently
  testify. It is moreover as difficult for us to enter into the crooked and complex
  methods of action which commended themselves to the statesmen of the period, as to
  appreciate the force of the cumbrous and abusive harangues which earned for Sir Edward
  Coke the character of an incomparable pleader. On the other hand, it appears certain
  that they who had so long played the game must have understood it best, and, whatever
  else may be said of them, they always contrived to win. In regard of Father Garnet, for
  example, we may think the evidence adduced by the prosecution quite insufficient, but
  none the less it in fact availed not only to send him to the gallows, but to brand him
  in popular estimation for generations, and even for centuries, as the arch-traitor to
  whose machinations the whole enterprise was due. <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>In the case of some individuals
  obnoxious to the government, it seems evident that downright forgery was actually
  practised.</p>

  <p>The question of Father Garnet's complicity, though usually considered as the one
  point in connection with the Plot requiring to be discussed, is not treated in the
  following pages. It is doubtless true that to prove the conspiracy to have been a trick
  of State, is not the same thing as proving that he was not entangled in it; but, at the
  same time, the first point, if it can be established, will deprive the other of almost
  all its interest. Nevertheless, Father Garnet's case will still require to be fully
  treated on its own merits, but this cannot be done within the limits of such an inquiry
  as the present. It is not by confining our attention to one isolated incident in his
  career, nor by discussing once again the familiar documents connected therewith, that
  we can form a sound and satisfactory judgment about him. For this purpose, full
  consideration must be given to what has hitherto been almost entirely ignored, the
  nature and character of the man, as exhibited especially during the eighteen years of
  his missionary life in England, during most of which period he acted as the superior of
  his brother Jesuits. There exist abundant materials for his biography, in his official
  and confidential correspondence, preserved at Stonyhurst and elsewhere, and not till
  the information thus supplied shall have been duly utilized will it be possible to
  judge whether the part assigned to him by his enemies in this wild and wicked design
  can, even conceivably, represent the truth. It may, I trust, be possible at no distant
  date to attempt this work, but it is not possible now, and to introduce this
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>topic into our
  present discussion would only confuse the issue which is before us.</p>

  <p>Except in one or two instances, I have judged it advisable, for the sake of
  clearness, to modernize the spelling of documents quoted in the text. In the notes they
  are usually given in their original form.</p>

  <p>I have to acknowledge my indebtedness in many particulars to Mr. H.W. Brewer, who
  not only contributes valuable sketches to illustrate the narrative, but has furnished
  many important notes and suggestions, based upon his exhaustive knowledge of ancient
  London. I have to thank the Marquis of Salisbury for permission to examine MSS. in the
  Hatfield collection, and his lordship's librarian, Mr. Gunton, for information supplied
  from the same source. Through the courtesy of the Deputy-Keeper of the Public Records,
  every facility has been afforded me for consulting the precious documents contained in
  the "Gunpowder Plot Book." The Dean of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, has kindly given
  me access to an important MS. in the College Library; and I have been allowed by the
  Rector of Stonyhurst to retain in my hands Father Greenway's MS. history of the Plot
  during the whole period of my work. The proprietors of the <i>Daily Graphic</i> have
  allowed me to use two sketches of the interior of "Guy Faukes' Cellar," and one of his
  lantern, originally prepared by Mr. Brewer for that journal.<span class=

  THE GUNPOWDER PLOT?</h2>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

  <h3>THE STATE OF THE QUESTION.</h3>

  <p class="ni"><span class="smcap">On</span> the morning of Tuesday, the 5th of
  November, 1605, which day was appointed for the opening of a new Parliamentary session,
  London rang with the news that in the course of the night a diabolical plot had been
  discovered, by which the king and legislature were to have been destroyed at a blow. In
  a chamber beneath the House of Lords had been found a great quantity of gunpowder, and
  with it a man, calling himself John Johnson, who, finding that the game was up, fully
  acknowledged his intention to have fired the magazine while the royal speech was being
  delivered, according to custom, overhead, and so to have blown King, Lords, and Commons
  into the air. At the same time, he doggedly refused to say who were his accomplices, or
  whether he had any.</p>

  <p>This is the earliest point at which the story of the Gunpowder Plot can be taken up
  with any certainty. Of what followed, at least as to the main outlines, we <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>are sufficiently well informed.
  Johnson, whose true name was presently found to be Guy, or Guido, Faukes,<sup><a name=
  "FN3A" id="FN3A"></a><a href="#FN3">[3]</a></sup> proved, it is true, a most obstinate
  and unsatisfactory witness, and obstinately refused to give any evidence which might
  incriminate others. But the actions of his confederates quickly supplied the
  information which he withheld. It was known that the "cellar" in which the powder was
  found, as well as a house adjacent, had been hired in the name of one Thomas Percy, a
  Catholic gentleman, perhaps a kinsman, and certainly a dependent, of the Earl of
  Northumberland. It was now discovered that he and others of his acquaintance had fled
  from London on the previous day, upon receipt of intelligence that the plot seemed at
  least to be suspected. Not many hours later the fugitives were heard of in
  Warwickshire, Worcestershire, and Staffordshire, the native counties of several amongst
  them, attempting to rally others to their desperate fortunes, and to levy war against
  the crown. For this purpose they forcibly seized cavalry horses<sup><a name="FN4A" id=
  "FN4A"></a><a href="#FN4">[4]</a></sup> at Warwick, and arms at Whewell Grange, a seat
  of Lord Windsor's. These violent proceedings having raised the country behind them,
  they were pursued by the sheriffs with what forces could be got together, and finally
  brought to bay at Holbeche, in Staffordshire, the residence of one Stephen Littleton, a
  Catholic gentleman.</p>

  <p>There proved to have been thirteen men in all who had undoubtedly been participators
  in the treason. Of these Faukes, as we have seen, was already in the <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>hands of justice. Another,
  Francis Tresham, had not fled with his associates, but remained quietly, and without
  attempting concealment, in London, even going to the council and offering them his
  services; after a week he was taken into custody. The eleven who either betook
  themselves to the country, or were already there, awaiting the issue of the enterprise,
  and prepared to co-operate in the rising which was to be its sequel, were Robert
  Catesby, Thomas Percy, Robert and Thomas Winter, John and Christopher Wright, John
  Grant, Robert Keyes, Ambrose Rokewood, Sir Everard Digby,and Thomas Bates. All were
  Catholics, and all, with the exception of Bates, Catesby's servant, were "gentlemen of
  blood and name," some of them, notably Robert Winter, Rokewood, Digby, and Tresham,
  being men of ample fortune.</p>

  </div>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

  <p>On Friday, November 8th, three days after the discovery, Sir Richard Walsh, sheriff
  of Worcestershire, attacked Holbeche. Catesby, Percy, and the two Wrights were killed
  or mortally wounded in the assault. The others were taken prisoners on the spot or in
  its neighbourhood, with the exception of Robert Winter, who, accompanied by their host,
  Stephen Littleton, contrived to elude capture for upwards of two months, being at last
  apprehended, in January, at Hagley Hall, Worcestershire. All the prisoners were at once
  taken up to London, and being there confined, were frequently and diligently examined
  by the council, to trace, if possible, farther ramifications of the conspiracy, and
  especially to inculpate the Catholic clergy.<sup><a name="FN5A" id="FN5A"></a><a href=
  "#FN5">[5]</a></sup> Torture, it is evident, was employed with this object.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, on November 9th, King James addressed to his Parliament a speech, wherein
  he declared that the abominable crime which had been intended was the direct result of
  Catholic principles, Popery being "the true mystery of iniquity." In like manner
  Chichester, the Lord Deputy in Ireland, was informed by Cecil, Earl of Salisbury, his
  Majesty's Secretary of State, that the Plot was an "abominable practice of Rome and
  Satan,"<sup><a name="FN6A" id="FN6A"></a><a href="#FN6">[6]</a></sup> while the monarch
  himself sent word to Sir John Harington that "these designs were not formed by a few,"
  that "the whole legion of Catholics were consulted," that "the priests were to
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>pacify their
  consciences, and the Pope confirm a general absolution for this glorious
  deed."<sup><a name="FN7A" id="FN7A"></a><a href="#FN7">[7]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Then follows an interval during which we know little of the course of events which
  were proceeding in the seclusion of the council-room and torture-chamber; but on
  December 4th we find Cecil complaining that he could obtain little or no evidence
  against the really important persons: "Most of the prisoners," he writes,<sup><a name=
  "FN8A" id="FN8A"></a><a href="#FN8">[8]</a></sup> "have wilfully forsworn that the
  priests knew anything in particular, and obstinately refuse to be accusers of them,
  yea, what torture soever they be put to."</p>

  <p>On January 15th, 1605-6, a proclamation was issued declaring that the Jesuit
  fathers, John Gerard, Henry Garnet, and Oswald Greenway, or Tesimond, were proved to
  have been "peculiarly practisers" in the treason, and offering a reward for their
  apprehension. On the 21st of the same month Parliament met, having been prorogued
  immediately after the king's speech of November 9th, and four days later an Act was
  passed for the perpetual solemnization of the anniversary of the projected crime, the
  preamble whereof charged its guilt upon "Many malignant and devilish papists, jesuits,
  and seminary priests, much envying the true and free possession of the Gospel by the
  nation, under the greatest, most learned, and most religious monarch who had ever
  occupied the throne."<sup><a name="FN9A" id="FN9A"></a><a href="#FN9">[9]</a></sup></p>

  <p>In consequence of this Act, was introduced into the Anglican liturgy the celebrated
  Fifth of November service, in the collect of which the king, royal family, <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>nobility, clergy, and commons
  are spoken of as having been "by Popish treachery appointed as sheep to the slaughter,
  in a most barbarous and savage manner, beyond the examples of former ages;" while the
  day itself was marked in the calendar as the "Papists' Conspiracy."</p>

  <p>It will thus be seen that the Powder Plot was by this time officially stigmatized as
  the work of the Catholic body in general, and in particular of their priests; thus
  acquiring an importance and a significance which could not be attributed to it were it
  but the wild attempt of a few turbulent men. As a natural corollary we find Parliament
  busily engaged upon measures to insure the more effectual execution of the penal
  laws.<sup><a name="FN10A" id="FN10A"></a><a href="#FN10">[10]</a></sup></p>

  <p>On January 27th the surviving conspirators, Robert and Thomas Winter, Faukes, Grant,
  Rokewood, Keyes, Digby, and Bates,<sup><a name="FN11A" id="FN11A"></a><a href=
  "#FN11">[11]</a></sup> were put upon their trial. In the indictment preferred against
  them, it was explicitly stated that the Plot was contrived by Garnet, Gerard, Greenway,
  and other Jesuits, to whose traitorous persuasions the prisoners at the bar had
  wickedly yielded. All were found guilty, Digby, Robert Winter, Grant, and Bates being
  executed at the west end of St. Paul's Church, on January the 30th, and the rest on the
  following day in Old Palace Yard.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

  <p>On the very day upon which the first company suffered, Father Garnet, whose
  hiding-place was known, and who had been closely invested for nine days, was captured,
  in company with another Jesuit, Father Oldcorne. The latter, though never charged with
  knowledge of the plot, was put to death for having aided and abetted Garnet in his
  attempt to escape. Garnet himself, being brought to London, was lodged first in the
  Gatehouse and afterwards in the Tower.</p>

  <p>As we have seen, he had already been proclaimed as a traitor, and "particular
  practiser" in the conspiracy, and had moreover been officially described as the head
  and front of the treason. Of the latter charge, after his capture, nothing was ever
  heard. Of his participation, proofs, it appeared, still remained to be discovered, for
  on the 3rd of March Cecil still spoke of them as in the future.<sup><a name="FN12A" id=
  "FN12A"></a><a href="#FN12">[12]</a></sup> In order to obtain the required evidence of
  his complicity, Garnet was examined three-and-twenty times before the council, and, in
  addition, various artifices were practised which need not now be detailed. On the 28th
  of March, 1606, he was brought to trial, and on May 3rd he was hanged at St. Paul's.
  The Gunpowder Conspirators were thenceforth described in government publications as
  "Garnet, a Jesuit, and his confederates."</p>

  <p>Such is, in outline, the course of events which followed the discovery of November
  5th, all circum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg
  8]</a></span>stances being here omitted which are by possibility open to dispute.</p>

  <p>It will probably be maintained, as our best and most circumspect historians appear
  to have assumed, that we are in possession of information enabling us to construct a
  similar sketch of what preceded and led up to these events,&mdash;whatever obscurity
  there may be regarding the complicity of those whose participation would invest the
  plot with the significance which has been attributed to it. If it were indeed but the
  individual design of a small knot of men, acting for themselves and of themselves,
  then, though they were all Catholics, and were actuated by a desire to aid the Catholic
  cause, the crime they intended could not justly be charged upon the body of their
  co-religionists. It would be quite otherwise if Catholics in general were shown to have
  countenanced it, or even if such representative men as members of the priesthood were
  found to have approved so abominable a project, or even to have consented to it, or
  knowingly kept silence regarding it. Of the complicity of Catholics in general or of
  their priesthood as a body there is no proof whatever, nor has it ever been seriously
  attempted to establish such a charge. As to the three Jesuits already named, who alone
  have been seriously accused, there is no proof, the sufficiency of which may not be
  questioned. But as to the fact that they who originated the Plot were Catholics, that
  they acted simply with the object of benefiting their Church, and that the nation most
  narrowly escaped an appalling disaster at their hands, can there be any reasonable
  doubt? Is not the account of their proceedings, to be read in any work on the
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>subject, as
  absolutely certain as anything in our history?</p>

  <p>This account is as follows. About a year after the accession of James
  I.,<sup><a name="FN13A" id="FN13A"></a><a href="#FN13">[13]</a></sup> when it began to
  be evident that the hopes of toleration at his hands, which the Catholics had
  entertained, were to be disappointed, Robert Catesby, a man of strong character, and
  with an extraordinary power of influencing others, bethought him in his wrath of this
  means whereby to take summary vengeance at once upon the monarch and the legislators,
  under whose cruelty he himself and his fellows were groaning. The plan was proposed to
  John Wright and Thomas Winter, who approved it. Faukes was brought over from the Low
  Countries, as a man likely to be of much service in such an enterprise. Shortly
  afterwards Percy joined them,<sup><a name="FN14A" id="FN14A"></a><a href=
  "#FN14">[14]</a></sup> and somewhat later Keyes and Christopher Wright were added to
  their number.<sup><a name="FN15A" id="FN15A"></a><a href="#FN15">[15]</a></sup> All the
  associates were required to take an oath of secrecy,<sup><a name="FN16A" id=
  "FN16A"></a><a href="#FN16">[16]</a></sup> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id=

  "FN17A" id="FN17A"></a><a href="#FN17">[17]</a></sup></p>

  <p>These are the seven "gentlemen of blood and name," as Faukes describes them, who had
  the main hand in the operations which we have to study. At a later period six others
  were associated with them, Robert Winter, elder brother of Thomas, and Grant, both
  gentlemen of property, Bates, Catesby's servant, and finally, Rokewood, Digby, and
  Tresham, all rich men, who were brought in chiefly for the sake of their wealth, and
  were enlisted when the preparations for the intended explosion had all been completed,
  in view of the rising which was to follow.<sup><a name="FN18A" id="FN18A"></a><a href=
  "#FN18">[18]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Commencing operations about the middle of December, 1604, these confederates first
  endeavoured to dig a mine under the House of Lords, and afterwards <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>hired a large room,
  described as a cellar, situated beneath the Peers' Chamber, and in this stored a
  quantity of gunpowder, which Faukes was to fire by a train, while the King, Lords, and
  Commons, were assembled above.</p>

  <p>Their enemies being thus destroyed, they did not contemplate a revolution, but were
  resolved to get possession of one of the king's sons, or, failing that, of one of his
  daughters, whom they would proclaim as sovereign, constituting themselves the guardians
  of the new monarch. They also contrived a "hunting match" on Dunsmoor heath, near
  Rugby, which was to be in progress when the news of the catastrophe in London should
  arrive; the sportsmen assembled for which would furnish, it was hoped, the nucleus of
  an army.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, as we are assured&mdash;and this is the crucial point of the whole
  story&mdash;the government of James I. had no suspicion of what was going on, and,
  lulled in false security, were on the verge of destruction, when a lucky circumstance
  intervened. On October 26th, ten days before the meeting of Parliament, a Catholic
  peer, Lord Monteagle, received an anonymous letter, couched in vague and incoherent
  language, warning him to absent himself from the opening ceremony. This document
  Monteagle at once took to the king's prime minister, Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury,
  who promptly divined its meaning and the precise danger indicated, although he allowed
  King James to fancy that he was himself the first to interpret it, when it was shown to
  him five days later.<sup><a name="FN19A" id="FN19A"></a><a href="#FN19">[19]</a></sup>
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>Not for four
  other days were active steps taken, that is, till the early morning of the fatal Fifth.
  Then took place the discovery of which we have already heard.</p>

  <p>Such is, in brief, the accepted version of the history, and of its substantial
  correctness there is commonly assumed to be no room for reasonable doubt. As Mr.
  Jardine writes,<sup><a name="FN20A" id="FN20A"></a><a href="#FN20">[20]</a></sup> "The
  outlines of the transaction were too notorious to be suppressed or disguised; that a
  design had been formed to blow up the Parliament House, with the King, the Royal
  Family, the Lords and Commons, and that this design was formed by Catholic men and for
  Catholic purposes, could never admit of controversy or concealment." In like manner,
  while acknowledging that in approaching the question of Father Garnet's complicity, or
  that of other priests, we find ourselves upon uncertain ground, Mr. Gardiner has no
  hesitation in declaring that "the whole story of the plot, as far as it relates to the
  lay conspirators, rests upon indisputable evidence."<sup><a name="FN21A" id=
  "FN21A"></a><a href="#FN21">[21]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Nevertheless there appear to be considerations, demanding more attention than they
  have hitherto received, which forbid the supposition that, in regard of what is most
  vital, this official story can possibly be true; while the extreme care with which it
  has obviously been elaborated, suggests the conclusion that it was intended to disguise
  facts, to the concealment of which the government of the day attached supreme
  importance.</p>

  <p>As has been said, the cardinal point of the tale, as <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>commonly told, is that the Plot was a secret
  and dangerous conspiracy, conducted with so much craft as to have baffled detection,
  but for a lucky accident; that the vigilance of the authorities was completely at
  fault; and that they found themselves suddenly on the very brink of a terrible
  catastrophe of which they had no suspicion.<sup><a name="FN22A" id="FN22A"></a><a href=
  "#FN22">[22]</a></sup> If, on the contrary, it should appear that they had ample
  information of what was going on, while feigning absolute ignorance; that they
  studiously devised a false account of the manner in which it came to their knowledge;
  and that their whole conduct is quite inconsistent with that sense of imminent danger
  which they so loudly professed&mdash;the question inevitably suggests itself as to
  whether we can rely upon the authenticity of the opening chapters of a history, the
  conclusion of which has been so dexterously manipulated.</p>

  <p>A French writer has observed<sup><a name="FN23A" id="FN23A"></a><a href=
  "#FN23">[23]</a></sup> that the plots undertaken under Elizabeth and James I. have this
  feature in common, that they proved, one and all, extremely opportune for those against
  whom they were directed. To this law the Gunpowder Plot was no exception. Whatever be
  the true history of its origin, it certainly placed in the hands of the king's chief
  minister a most effective weapon for the enforcement of his favourite <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>policy, and very materially
  strengthened his own position. Without doubt the sensational manner of its "discovery"
  largely contributed to its success in this respect; and if this were ingeniously
  contrived for such a purpose, may it not be that a like ingenuity had been employed in
  providing the material destined to be so artistically utilized?</p>

  <p>There can be no question as to the wide prevalence of the belief that previous plots
  had owed their origin to the policy of the statesmen who finally detected them, a
  belief witnessed to by Lord Castlemaine,<sup><a name="FN24A" id="FN24A"></a><a href=
  "#FN24">[24]</a></sup> who declares that "it was a piece of wit in Queen Elizabeth's
  days to draw men into such devices," and that "making and fomenting plots was then in
  fashion; nor can it be denied that good grounds for such an opinion were not lacking".
  The unfortunate man Squires had been executed on the ridiculous charge that he had come
  over from Spain in order to poison the pommel of Queen Elizabeth's saddle. Dr. Parry,
  we are informed by Bishop Goodman, whose verdict is endorsed by Mr.
  Brewer,<sup><a name="FN25A" id="FN25A"></a><a href="#FN25">[25]</a></sup> was put to
  death by those who knew him to be guiltless in their regard, they having themselves
  employed him in the business for which he suffered. Concerning Babington's famous plot,
  it is absolutely certain that, whatever its origin, it was, almost from the first,
  fully known to Walsingham, through whose hands passed the correspondence between the
  conspirators, and who assiduously worked the enterprise, in order to turn it to the
  destruction of the Queen of Scots. As to Lopez, the Jewish physician, it is impossible
  not to concur in the verdict <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg
  15]</a></span>that his condemnation was at least as much owing to political intrigue as
  to the weight of evidence.<sup><a name="FN26A" id="FN26A"></a><a href=
  "#FN26">[26]</a></sup> Concerning this period Mr. Brewer says: "The Roman Catholics
  seem to have made just complaints of the subtle and unworthy artifices of Leicester and
  Walsingham, by whom they were entrapped into the guilt of high treason. 'And verily,'
  as [Camden] expresses it, there were at this time crafty ways devised to try how men
  stood affected; counterfeit letters were sent in the name of the Queen of Scots and
  left at papists' houses; spies were sent up and down the country to note people's
  dispositions and lay hold of their words; and reporters of vain and idle stories were
  credited and encouraged."<sup><a name="FN27A" id="FN27A"></a><a href=
  "#FN27">[27]</a></sup> Under King James,<sup><a name="FN28A" id="FN28A"></a><a href=
  "#FN28">[28]</a></sup> as Bishop Goodman declares, the priest Watson was hanged for
  treason by those who had employed him.<sup><a name="FN29A" id="FN29A"></a><a href=
  "#FN29">[29]</a></sup></p>

  <p>It must farther be observed that the particular Plot which is our subject was
  stamped with certain features more than commonly suspicious. Even on the face of
  things, as will be seen from the summary already given, it was steadily utilized from
  the first for a purpose <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg
  16]</a></span>which it could not legitimately be made to serve. That the Catholics of
  England, as a body, had any connection with it there is not, nor ever appeared to be,
  any vestige of a proof; still less that the official superiors of the Church, including
  the Pope himself, were concerned in it. Yet the first act of the government was to lay
  it at the door of all these, thus investing it with a character which was, indeed,
  eminently fitted to sustain their own policy, but to which it was no-wise entitled.
  Even in regard of Father Garnet and his fellow Jesuits, whatever judgment may now be
  formed concerning them, it is clear that it was determined to connect them with the
  conspiracy long before any evidence at all was forthcoming to sustain the charge. The
  actual confederates were, in fact, treated throughout as in themselves of little or no
  account, and as important only in so far as they might consent to incriminate those
  whom the authorities wished to be incriminated.</p>

  <p>The determined manner in which this object was ever kept in view, the unscrupulous
  means constantly employed for its attainment, the vehemence with which matters were
  asserted to have been proved, any proof of which was never even seriously
  attempted&mdash;in a word, the elaborate system of falsification by which alone the
  story of the conspiracy was made to suit the purpose it so effectually served, can
  inspire us with no confidence that the foundation upon which such a superstructure was
  erected, was itself what it was said to be.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, when we examine into the details supplied to us as to the
  progress of the affair, we find that much of what the conspirators are said
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>to have done is
  well-nigh incredible, while it is utterly impossible that if they really acted in the
  manner described, the public authorities should not have had full knowledge of their
  proceedings. We also find not only that the same authorities, while feigning ignorance
  of anything of the kind, were perfectly well aware that these very conspirators had
  something in hand, but that long before the "discovery," in fact, at the very time when
  the conspiracy is said to have been hatched, their officials were working a Catholic
  plot, by means of secret agents, and even making arrangements as to who were to be
  implicated therein.</p>

  <p>These are, in brief, some of the considerations which point to a conclusion utterly
  at variance with the received version of the story, the conclusion, namely, that, for
  purposes of State, the government of the day either found means to instigate the
  conspirators to undertake their enterprise, or, at least, being, from an early stage of
  the undertaking, fully aware of what was going on, sedulously nursed the insane scheme
  till the time came to make capital out of it. That the conspirators, or the greater
  number of them, really meant to strike a great blow is not to be denied, though it may
  be less easy to assure ourselves as to its precise character; and their guilt will not
  be palliated should it appear that, in projecting an atrocious crime, they were
  unwittingly playing the game of plotters more astute than themselves. At the same time,
  while fully endorsing the sentiment of a Catholic writer,<sup><a name="FN30A" id=
  "FN30A"></a><a href="#FN30">[30]</a></sup> that they who suffer themselves to be drawn
  into a plot like fools, deserve to be hanged for it like <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>knaves, it is impossible not to agree with
  another when he writes:<sup><a name="FN31A" id="FN31A"></a><a href=
  "#FN31">[31]</a></sup> "This account does not excuse the conspirators, but lays a heavy
  weight upon the devils who tempted them beyond their strength."</p>

  <p>The view thus set forth will perhaps be considered unworthy of serious discussion,
  and it must be fully admitted, that there can be no excuse for making charges such as
  it involves, unless solid grounds can be alleged for so doing. That any such grounds
  are to be found historians of good repute utterly deny. Mr. Hallam roundly
  declares:<sup><a name="FN32A" id="FN32A"></a><a href="#FN32">[32]</a></sup> "To deny
  that there was such a plot, or, which is the same thing, to throw the whole on the
  contrivance and management of Cecil, as has sometimes been done, argues great
  effrontery in those who lead, and great stupidity in those who follow." Similarly, Mr.
  Gardiner,<sup><a name="FN33A" id="FN33A"></a><a href="#FN33">[33]</a></sup> while
  allowing that contemporaries accused Cecil of inventing the Plot, is content to dismiss
  such a charge as "absurd."</p>

  <p>Whether it be so or not we have now to inquire.</p>

    Winter, November 23rd, 1605. This&mdash;as we shall see, a most suspicious
    document&mdash;was one of the two selected for publication, on which the traditional

    matters, was omitted from the published version of the confession.</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

  <h3>THE PERSONS CONCERNED.</h3>

  <p class="ni"><span class="smcap">At</span> the period with which we have to deal the
  chief minister of James I. was Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury,<sup><a name="FN34A" id=
  "FN34A"></a><a href="#FN34">[34]</a></sup> the political heir of his father, William
  Cecil, Lord Burghley,<sup><a name="FN35A" id="FN35A"></a><a href="#FN35">[35]</a></sup>
  and of Walsingham, his predecessor in the office of secretary. It is clear that he had
  inherited from them ideas of statesmanship of the order then in vogue, and from nature,
  the kind of ability required to put these successfully in practice. Sir Robert Naunton
  thus describes him:<sup><a name="FN36A" id="FN36A"></a><a href=
  "#FN36">[36]</a></sup></p>

  <p>"This great minister of state, and the staff of the Queen's declining age, though
  his little crooked person<sup><a name="FN37A" id="FN37A"></a><a href=
  "#FN37">[37]</a></sup> could not provide any great supportation, yet <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>it carried thereon a head
  and a headpiece of vast content, and therein, it seems, nature was so diligent to
  complete one, and the best, part about him, as that to the perfection of his memory and
  intellectuals, she took care also of his senses, and to put him in <i>Lynceos
  oculos</i>, or to pleasure him the more, borrowed of Argus, so to give him a perfective
  sight. And for the rest of his sensitive virtues, his predecessor had left him a
  receipt, to smell out what was done in the Conclave; and his good old father was so
  well seen in the mathematicks, as that he could tell you throughout Spain, every part,
  every ship, with their burthens, whither bound, what preparation, what impediments for
  diversion of enterprises, counsels, and resolutions." The writer then proceeds to give
  a striking instance to show "how docible was this little man."</p>

  <p>Of his character, as estimated by competent judges, his contemporaries, we have very
  different accounts. Mr. Gardiner, who may fairly be chosen to represent his apologists,
  speaks thus:<sup><a name="FN38A" id="FN38A"></a><a href="#FN38">[38]</a></sup></p>

  <p>"Although there are circumstances in his life which tell against him, it is
  difficult to read the whole of the letters and documents which have come down to us
  from his pen, without becoming gradually convinced of his honesty of intention. It
  cannot be denied that he was satisfied with the ordinary morality of his <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>time, and that he thought it
  no shame to keep a State secret or to discover a plot by means of a falsehood. If he
  grasped at power as one who took pleasure in the exercise of it, he used it for what he
  regarded as the true interests of his king and country. Nor are we left to his own acts
  and words as the only means by which we are enabled to form a judgment of his
  character. Of all the statesmen of the day, not one has left a more blameless character
  than the Earl of Dorset. Dorset took the opportunity of leaving upon record in his
  will, which would not be read till he had no longer injury or favour to expect in this
  world, the very high admiration in which his colleague was held by him."</p>

  <p>This, it must be allowed, is a somewhat facile species of argument. Though wills are
  not formally opened until after the testators' deaths, it is not impossible for their
  contents to be previously communicated to others, when there is an object for so
  doing.<sup><a name="FN39A" id="FN39A"></a><a href="#FN39">[39]</a></sup> But, however
  this may be, it can scarcely be said that the weight of evidence tends in this
  direction. Not to mention the fact that, while enjoying the entire confidence of Queen
  Elizabeth, Cecil was engaged in a secret correspondence with King James, which she
  would have regarded as treasonable&mdash;and which he so carefully concealed that for a
  century afterwards and more it was not suspected&mdash;there remains the other
  indubitable fact, that while similarly trusted by James, and while all affairs of State
  were entirely in his hands, he was in receipt of a secret pension from the King of
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg
  22]</a></span>Spain,<sup><a name="FN40A" id="FN40A"></a><a href="#FN40">[40]</a></sup>
  the very monarch any communication with whom he treated as treason on the part of
  others.<sup><a name="FN41A" id="FN41A"></a><a href="#FN41">[41]</a></sup> It is certain
  that the Earl of Essex, when on his trial, asserted that Cecil had declared the Spanish
  Infanta to be the rightful heir to the crown, and though the secretary vehemently
  denied the imputation, he equally repudiated the notion that he favoured the King of
  Scots.<sup><a name="FN42A" id="FN42A"></a><a href="#FN42">[42]</a></sup> We know,
  moreover, that one who as Spanish Ambassador had dealings with him, pronounced him to
  be a venal traitor, who was ready to sell his soul for money,<sup><a name="FN43A" id=
  "FN43A"></a><a href="#FN43">[43]</a></sup> while another intimated<sup><a name="FN44A"
  id="FN44A"></a><a href="#FN44">[44]</a></sup> that <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>it was in his power to have charged him with
  "unwarrantable practices." Similarly, we hear from the French minister of the ingrained
  habit of falsehood which made it impossible for the English secretary to speak the
  truth even to friends;<sup><a name="FN45A" id="FN45A"></a><a href=
  "#FN45">[45]</a></sup> and, from the French Ambassador, of the resolution imputed to
  the same statesman, to remove from his path every rival who seemed likely to jeopardize
  his tenure of power.<sup><a name="FN46A" id="FN46A"></a><a href=
  "#FN46">[46]</a></sup></p>

  <p>What was the opinion of his own countrymen, appeared with startling emphasis when,
  in 1612, the Earl died. On May 22nd we find the Earl of Northampton writing to
  Rochester that the "little man" is dead, "for which so many rejoice, and so few even
  seem to be sorry."<sup><a name="FN47A" id="FN47A"></a><a href="#FN47">[47]</a></sup>
  Five days later, Chamberlain, writing<sup><a name="FN48A" id="FN48A"></a><a href=
  "#FN48">[48]</a></sup> to his friend Dudley Carleton, to announce the same event, thus
  expresses himself: "As the case stands it was best that he gave over the world, for
  they say his friends fell from him apace, and some near about him, and however he had
  fared <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>with his
  health, it is verily thought he would never have been himself again in power and
  credit. I never knew so great a man so soon and so openly censured, for men's tongues
  walk very liberally and freely, but how truly I cannot judge." On June 25th he again
  reports: "The outrageous speeches against the deceased Lord continue still, and there
  be fresh libels come out every day, and I doubt his actions will be hardly censured in
  the next parliament, if the King be not the more gracious to repress them." Moreover,
  his funeral was attended by few or none of the gentry, and those only were present
  whose official position compelled them. His own opinion Chamberlain expresses in two
  epigrams and an anagram, which, although of small literary merit, contrive clearly to
  express the most undisguised animosity and contempt for the late minister.<sup><a name=
  "FN49A" id="FN49A"></a><a href="#FN49">[49]</a></sup></p>

  <p>There is abundant proof that such sentiments were not first entertained when he had
  passed away, though, naturally, they were less openly expressed when he was alive and
  practically all powerful. Cecil seems, in fact, to have been throughout his career a
  lonely man, with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg
  25]</a></span>no real friends and many enemies, desperately fighting for his own hand,
  and for the retention of that power which he prized above all else, aspiring, as a
  contemporary satirist puts it, to be "both shepherd and dog."<sup><a name="FN50A" id=
  "FN50A"></a><a href="#FN50">[50]</a></sup> Since the accession of James he had felt his
  tenure of office to be insecure. Goodman tells us<sup><a name="FN51A" id=
  "FN51A"></a><a href="#FN51">[51]</a></sup> that "it is certain the king did not love
  him;" Osborne,<sup><a name="FN52A" id="FN52A"></a><a href="#FN52">[52]</a></sup> "that
  he had forfeited the love of the people by the hate he expressed to their darling
  Essex, and the desire he had to render justice and prerogative arbitrary."<sup><a name=
  "FN53A" id="FN53A"></a><a href="#FN53">[53]</a></sup> Sir Anthony Weldon speaks of
  him<sup><a name="FN54A" id="FN54A"></a><a href="#FN54">[54]</a></sup> as <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>"Sir Robert Cecil, a very
  wise man, but much hated in England by reason of the fresh bleeding of that universally
  beloved Earl of Essex, and for that clouded also in the king's favour." De la Boderie,
  the French Ambassador, tells us<sup><a name="FN55A" id="FN55A"></a><a href=
  "#FN55">[55]</a></sup> that the nobility were exceedingly jealous of his dignity and
  power, and<sup><a name="FN56A" id="FN56A"></a><a href="#FN56">[56]</a></sup> that he in
  his turn was jealous of the growing influence of Prince Henry, the heir apparent, who
  made no secret of his dislike of him. Meanwhile there were rivals who, it seemed not
  improbable, might supplant him. One of these, Sir Walter Raleigh, had already been
  rendered harmless on account of his connection with the "Main," the mysterious
  conspiracy which inaugurated the reign of James. There remained the Earl of
  Northumberland, and it may be remarked in passing that one of the effects of the
  Gunpowder Plot was to dispose of him likewise.<sup><a name="FN57A" id=
  "FN57A"></a><a href="#FN57">[57]</a></sup> Even the apologists of the <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>minister do not attempt to
  deny either the fact that he was accustomed to work by stratagems and disguises, nor
  the obloquy that followed on his death;<sup><a name="FN58A" id="FN58A"></a><a href=
  "#FN58">[58]</a></sup> while by friends and foes alike he was compared to Ulysses of
  many wiles.<sup><a name="FN59A" id="FN59A"></a><a href="#FN59">[59]</a></sup></p>

  <p>But amongst those whom he had to dread, there can be no doubt that the members of
  the Catholic <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg
  28]</a></span>party appeared to the secretary the most formidable. It was known on all
  hands, nor did he attempt to disguise the fact, that he was the irreconcilable opponent
  of any remission of the penal laws enacted for the purpose of stamping out the old
  faith.<sup><a name="FN60A" id="FN60A"></a><a href="#FN60">[60]</a></sup> The work,
  however, had as yet been very incompletely done. At the beginning of the reign of King
  James, the Catholics formed at least a half, probably a majority,<sup><a name="FN61A"
  id="FN61A"></a><a href="#FN61">[61]</a></sup> of the English people. There were amongst
  them many noblemen, fitted to hold offices of State. Moreover, the king, who before his
  accession had unquestionably <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg
  29]</a></span>assured the Catholics at least of toleration,<sup><a name="FN62A" id=
  "FN62A"></a><a href="#FN62">[62]</a></sup> showed at his first coming a manifest
  disposition to relieve them from the grievous persecution under which they had groaned
  so long.<sup><a name="FN63A" id="FN63A"></a><a href="#FN63">[63]</a></sup> He remitted
  a large part of the fines which had so grievously pressed upon all recusants, declaring
  that he would not make merchandise of conscience, nor set a price upon
  faith;<sup><a name="FN64A" id="FN64A"></a><a href="#FN64">[64]</a></sup> he invited to
  his presence leading Catholics from various parts of the country, assuring them, and
  bidding them assure their co-religionists, of his gracious intentions in their
  regard;<sup><a name="FN65A" id="FN65A"></a><a href="#FN65">[65]</a></sup> titles of
  honour and lucrative employments were bestowed on some of their number;<sup><a name=
  "FN66A" id="FN66A"></a><a href="#FN66">[66]</a></sup> one professed Catholic, Henry
  Howard, presently created Earl of Northampton, being enrolled in the Privy Council; and
  in the first speech which he addressed to his Parliament James declared that, as to the
  papists, he had no desire to persecute them, especially those of the laity who would be
  quiet.<sup><a name="FN67A" id="FN67A"></a><a href="#FN67">[67]</a></sup> The immediate
  effect <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>of this
  milder policy was to afford evidence of the real strength of the Catholics, many now
  openly declaring themselves who had previously conformed to the State church. In the
  diocese of Chester alone the number of Catholics was increased by a
  thousand.<sup><a name="FN68A" id="FN68A"></a><a href="#FN68">[68]</a></sup></p>

  <p>It is scarcely to be wondered at that men who were familiar with the political
  methods of the age should see in all this a motive sufficient to explain a great stroke
  for the destruction of those who appeared to be so formidable, devised by such a
  minister as was then in power, "the statesman," writes Lord Castlemaine,<sup><a name=
  "FN69A" id="FN69A"></a><a href="#FN69">[69]</a></sup> "who bore (as everybody knew) a
  particular hatred to all of our profession, and this increased to hear his Majesty
  speak a little in his first speech to the two Houses against persecution of papists,
  whereas there had been nothing within those walls but invectives and defamations for
  above forty years together."</p>

  <p>This much is certain, that, whatever its origin, the Gunpowder Plot immensely
  increased Cecil's influence and power, and, for a time, even his popularity, assuring
  the success of that anti-Catholic policy with which he was identified.<sup><a name=
  "FN70A" id="FN70A"></a><a href="#FN70">[70]</a></sup></p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

  <p>Of no less importance is it to understand the position of the Catholic body, and the
  character of the particular Catholics who engaged in this enterprise. We have seen with
  what hopes the advent of King James had been hailed by those who had suffered so much
  for his mother's sake, and who interpreted in a too sanguine and trustful spirit his
  own words and deeds. Their dream of enjoying even toleration at his hands was soon
  rudely dispelled. After giving them the briefest of respites, the monarch, under the
  influence, as all believed, of his council, and especially of his chief
  minister,<sup><a name="FN71A" id="FN71A"></a><a href="#FN71">[71]</a></sup> suddenly
  reversed his line of action and persecuted his Catholic subjects more cruelly than had
  his predecessor, calling up the arrears of fines which they fancied had been altogether
  remitted, ruining many in the process who had hitherto contrived to pay their
  way,<sup><a name="FN72A" id="FN72A"></a><a href="#FN72">[72]</a></sup> and adding to
  the sense of injury which such <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg
  32]</a></span>a course necessarily provoked by farming out wealthy recusants to needy
  courtiers, "to make their profit of," in particular to the Scots who had followed their
  royal master across the border. Soon it was announced that the king would have blood;
  all priests were ordered to leave the realm under pain of death, and the searches for
  them became more frequent and violent than ever. In no long time, as Goodman tells
  us,<sup><a name="FN73A" id="FN73A"></a><a href="#FN73">[73]</a></sup> "a gentlewoman
  was hanged only for relieving and harbouring a priest; a citizen was hanged only for
  being reconciled to the Church of Rome; besides the penal laws were such and so
  executed that they could not subsist." Father Gerard says:<sup><a name="FN74A" id=
  "FN74A"></a><a href="#FN74">[74]</a></sup> "This being known to Catholics, it is easy
  to be seen how first their hopes were turned into fears, and then their fears into full
  knowledge that all the contrary to that they had hoped was intended and prepared for
  them", and, as one of the victims of these proceedings wrote, "the times of Elizabeth,
  although most cruel, were the mildest and happiest in comparison with those of King
  James."<sup><a name="FN75A" id="FN75A"></a><a href="#FN75">[75]</a></sup></p>

  <p>In such circumstances, the Catholic body being so numerous as it was, it is not to
  be wondered at that individuals should be found, who, smarting under their injuries,
  and indignant at the bad faith of which they considered themselves the dupes, looked to
  violent remedies for relief, and might without difficulty be worked upon to that
  effect. Their case seemed far more hopeless than ever. Queen Elizabeth's quarrel with
  Rome had been in a great degree personal; and moreover, as she had no direct heir, it
  was confidently <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg
  33]</a></span>anticipated that the demise of the crown would introduce a new era. King
  James's proceedings, on the other hand, seemed to indicate a deliberate policy which
  there was no prospect of reversing, especially as his eldest son, should he prove true
  to his promise, might be expected to do that zealously, and of himself, which his
  father was held to do under the constraint of others.<sup><a name="FN76A" id=
  "FN76A"></a><a href="#FN76">[76]</a></sup> As Sir Everard Digby warned Cecil, in the
  remarkable letter which he addressed to him on the subject:<sup><a name="FN77A" id=
  "FN77A"></a><a href="#FN77">[77]</a></sup> "If your Lordship and the State think fit to
  deal severely with the Catholics, within brief space there will be massacres,
  rebellions, and desperate attempts against the King and the State. For it is a general
  received reason among Catholics, that there is not that expecting and suffering course
  now to be run that was in the Queen's time, who was the last of her line, and last in
  expectance to run violent courses against Catholics; for then it was hoped that the
  King that now is, would have been at least free from persecuting, as his promise was
  before his coming into this realm, and as divers his promises have been since his
  coming. All these promises every man sees broken."<sup><a name="FN78A" id=
  "FN78A"></a><a href="#FN78">[78]</a></sup></p>

  <p>It must likewise be remembered that if stratagems and "practices" were the
  recognized weapons of ministers, turbulence and arms were, at this period, the
  familiar, and indeed the only, resource of those in <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>opposition, nor did any stigma attach to their
  employment unless taken up on the losing side. Not a little of this kind of thing had
  been done on behalf of James himself. As is well known, he succeeded to the throne by a
  title upon which he could not have recovered at law an acre of land.<sup><a name=
  "FN79A" id="FN79A"></a><a href="#FN79">[79]</a></sup> Elizabeth had so absolutely
  forbidden all discussion of the question of the succession as to leave it in a state of
  utter confusion.<sup><a name="FN80A" id="FN80A"></a><a href="#FN80">[80]</a></sup>
  There were more than a dozen possible competitors, and amongst these the claim of the
  King of Scots was technically not the strongest, for though nearest in blood his claims
  had been barred by a special Act of Parliament, excluding the Scottish line. As
  Professor Thorold Rogers says, "For a year after his accession James, if Acts of
  Parliament are to go for anything, was not legally King."<sup><a name="FN81A" id=
  "FN81A"></a><a href="#FN81">[81]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Nevertheless the cause of James was vigorously taken up in all directions, and
  promoted by means which might well have been styled treason against the authority of
  Parliament. Thus, old Sir Thomas Tresham, father of Francis Tresham, the Gunpowder
  Conspirator, who had been an eminent sufferer for his religion, at considerable
  personal risk, and against much resistance on the part of the local magistrates and the
  populace, publicly proclaimed the new king at Northampton, while Francis Tresham
  himself and his brother Lewis, with Lord Monteagle, their brother-in-law, supported the
  Earl of Southampton in holding the Tower of London on his behalf.<sup><a name="FN82A"
  id="FN82A"></a><a href="#FN82">[82]</a></sup> In London indeed <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>everybody took to arms as
  soon as the queen's illness had been known; watch and ward were kept in the City; rich
  men brought their plate and treasure from the country, and placed them where they would
  be safest,<sup><a name="FN83A" id="FN83A"></a><a href="#FN83">[83]</a></sup> and the
  approaches were guarded. Cecil himself related in open court, in praise of the
  Londoners, how, when he himself, attended by most of the peers and privy councillors of
  the kingdom, wished to enter the City to proclaim the new sovereign, they found the
  gates closed against them till they had publicly declared that they were about to
  proclaim James and no one else.<sup><a name="FN84A" id="FN84A"></a><a href=
  "#FN84">[84]</a></sup></p>

  <p>In times when statesmen could approve such methods of political action, it was
  inevitable that violent enterprises should have come to be considered the natural
  resource of those out of power, and it is very clear that there were numerous
  individuals, of whom no one party had the monopoly, who were ready at any moment to
  risk everything for the cause they served, and such men, although their proclivities
  were well known, did not suffer much in public esteem.</p>

  <p>The Gunpowder Conspirators were eminently men of this stamp, and notoriously so. So
  well was their character known, that when, in 1596, eight years before the commencement
  of the Plot, Queen Elizabeth had been unwell, the Lords of the Council, as a
  precautionary measure arrested some of the principal amongst them, Catesby, the two
  Wrights, Tresham, and others, as being persons who would certainly give <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>trouble should a chance
  occur.<sup><a name="FN85A" id="FN85A"></a><a href="#FN85">[85]</a></sup> Since that
  time they had not improved their record. All those above-named, as well as Thomas
  Winter, Christopher Wright, Percy, Grant, and perhaps others, had been engaged in the
  ill-starred rebellion of Essex, on which occasion Catesby was wounded, and both he and
  Tresham came remarkably near being hanged.<sup><a name="FN86A" id="FN86A"></a><a href=
  "#FN86">[86]</a></sup> They had likewise been variously implicated in all the seditious
  attempts which had since been made&mdash;Catesby and Tresham being named by Sir Edward
  Coke as being engaged with Watson in the "Bye." Thomas Winter, Christopher Wright, and
  Faukes, had, if we may believe the same authority, been sent to Spain on treasonable
  embassies.<sup><a name="FN87A" id="FN87A"></a><a href="#FN87">[87]</a></sup> Grant made
  himself very conspicuous by frequently resisting the officers of the law <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>when they appeared to search
  his house.<sup><a name="FN88A" id="FN88A"></a><a href="#FN88">[88]</a></sup> John
  Wright and Percy had, at least till a very recent period, been notorious bravoes, who
  made a point of picking a quarrel with any man who was reported to be a good swordsman,
  they being both expert with the weapon.<sup><a name="FN89A" id="FN89A"></a><a href=
  "#FN89">[89]</a></sup></p>

  <p>It is evident that men of this stamp were not unlikely to prove restive under such
  treatment as was meted out to the Catholics, from which moreover, as gentlemen, they
  themselves suffered in a special degree. Lord Castlemaine remarks that loose people may
  usually be drawn into a plot when statesmen lay gins, and that it was no hard thing for
  a Secretary of State, should he desire any such thing, to know of turbulent and
  ambitious spirits to be his unconscious instruments,<sup><a name="FN90A" id=
  "FN90A"></a><a href="#FN90">[90]</a></sup> and it is obvious that no great perspicacity
  would have been required to fix upon those who had given such evidence of their
  disposition as had these men.</p>

  <p>It must, at the same time, be confessed that the character of the plotters is one of
  the most perplexing features of the Plot. The crime contemplated was without parallel
  in its brutal and senseless atrocity. There had, it is true, been powder-plots before,
  notably that which had effected the destruction of the king's own father, Lord Darnley,
  a fact undoubtedly calculated <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg
  38]</a></span>to make much impression upon the timorous mind of James. But what marked
  off our Gunpowder Plot from all others, was the wholesale and indiscriminate slaughter
  in which it must have resulted, and the absence of any possibility that the cause could
  be benefited which the conspirators had at heart. It was at once reprobated and
  denounced by the Catholics of England, and by the friends and near relatives of the
  conspirators themselves.<sup><a name="FN91A" id="FN91A"></a><a href=
  "#FN91">[91]</a></sup> It might be supposed that those who undertook such an enterprise
  were criminals of the deepest dye, and ruffians of a more than usually repulsive type.
  In spite, however, of the turbulent element in their character of which we have seen
  something, such a judgment would, in the opinion of historians, be altogether
  erroneous. Far from their being utterly unredeemed villains, it appears, in fact, that
  apart from the one monstrous transgression which has made them infamous, they should be
  distinguished in the annals of crime as the least disreputable gang of conspirators who
  ever plotted a treason. On this point we have ample evidence from those who are by no
  means their friends. "Atrocious as their whole undertaking was," writes Mr.
  Gardiner,<sup><a name="FN92A" id="FN92A"></a><a href="#FN92">[92]</a></sup> "great as
  must have been the moral obliquity of their minds before they could have conceived such
  a project, there was at least nothing mean or selfish about them. They boldly risked
  their lives for what they honestly <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id=
  "Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>believed to be the cause of God and of their country.
  Theirs was a crime which it would never have entered into the heart of any man to
  commit who was not raised above the low aims of the ordinary criminal." Similarly Mr.
  Jardine, a still less friendly witness, tells us<sup><a name="FN93A" id=
  "FN93A"></a><a href="#FN93">[93]</a></sup> that "several at least of the conspirators
  were men of mild and amiable manners, averse to tumults and bloodshed, and dwelling
  quietly amidst the humanities of domestic life," a description which he applies
  especially to Rokewood and Digby; while of Guy Faukes himself he says<sup><a name=
  "FN94A" id="FN94A"></a><a href="#FN94">[94]</a></sup> that, according to the accounts
  which we hear of him, he is not to be regarded as a mercenary ruffian, ready for hire
  to do any deed of blood; but as a zealot, misled by misguided fanaticism, who was,
  however, by no means destitute either of piety or of humanity. Moreover, as Mr. Jardine
  farther remarks, the conspirators as a body were of the class which we should least
  expect to find engaged in desperate enterprises, being, as Sir E. Coke described them,
  "gentlemen of good houses, of excellent parts, and of very competent fortunes and
  estates," none of them, except perhaps Catesby, being in pecuniary difficulties, while
  several&mdash;notably Robert Winter, Rokewood, Digby, Tresham, and Grant&mdash;were men
  of large possessions. It has also been observed by a recent biographer of Sir Everard
  Digby,<sup><a name="FN95A" id="FN95A"></a><a href="#FN95">[95]</a></sup> that, for the
  furtherance of their projects after the explosion, the confederates were able to
  provide a sum equal at least to &pound;75,000 of our money&mdash;a sufficient proof of
  their worldly position.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

  <p>That men of such a class should so lightly and easily have adopted a scheme so
  desperate and atrocious as that of "murdering a kingdom in its representatives," is
  undoubtedly not the least incomprehensible feature of this strange story. At the same
  time it must not be forgotten that there is another, and a very different account of
  these men, which comes to us on the authority of a Catholic priest living in England at
  the time,<sup><a name="FN96A" id="FN96A"></a><a href="#FN96">[96]</a></sup> who speaks
  of the conspirators as follows:</p>

  <p>"They were a few wicked and desperate wretches, whom many Protestants termed
  Papists, although the priests and the true Catholics knew them not to be such.... They
  were never frequenters of Catholic Sacraments with any priest, as I could ever learn;
  and, as all the Protestant Courts will witness, not one of them was a convicted or
  known Catholic or Recusant."<sup><a name="FN97A" id="FN97A"></a><a href=
  "#FN97">[97]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Similarly Cornwallis, writing from Madrid,<sup><a name="FN98A" id=
  "FN98A"></a><a href="#FN98">[98]</a></sup> reported that the king and Estate of Spain
  were "much grieved that they being atheists and devils in their inward parts, should
  paint their outside with Catholicism."</p>

  <p>In view of evidence so contradictory, it is difficult, if not impossible, to form a

    <p class="ni"><sup><a name="FN34" id="FN34"></a><a href="#FN34A">[34]</a></sup> When
    James came to the throne Cecil was but a knight. He was created Baron Cecil of
    Essendon, May 13th, 1603; Viscount Cranborne, August 20th, 1604; Earl of Salisbury,
    May 4th, 1605.</p>

    Robert, as the second son, did not succeed to his father's title, which devolved upon
    Thomas, the eldest, who was created Earl of Exeter on the same day on which Robert
    became Earl of Salisbury.</p>

    was but little above five feet in height, and, in the phrase of the time, a
    "Crouchback." King James, who was not a man of much delicacy in such matters, was
    fond of giving him nicknames in consequence. Cecil wrote to Sir Thomas Lake, October
    24th, 1605: "I see nothing y<sup>t</sup> I can doe, can procure me so much favor, as
    to be sure one whole day what title I shall have another. For from Essenden to
    Cranborne, from Cranborne to Salisbury, from Salisbury to Beagle, from Beagle to Thom
    Derry, from Thom Derry to Parret which I hate most, I have been so walked, as I think
    by y<sup>t</sup> I come to Theobalds, I shall be called Tare or Sophie." (R.O.

    <p class="ni"><sup><a name="FN41" id="FN41"></a><a href="#FN41A">[41]</a></sup> At
    the trial of Essex, Cecil exclaimed, "I pray God to consume me where I stand, if I
    hate not the Spaniard as much as any man living." (Bruce, <i>Introduction to Secret
    Correspondence of Sir R. Cecil</i>, xxxiii.)</p>

    <p>Of the Spanish pension Mr. Gardiner, after endeavouring to show that originally
    Cecil's acceptance of it may have been comparatively innocent, thus continues
    (<i>History of England</i>, i. 216): "But it is plain that, even if this is the
    explanation of his original intentions, such a comparatively innocent connection with
    Spain soon extended itself to something worse, and that he consented to furnish the
    ambassadors, from time to time, with information on the policy and intentions of the
    English Government.... Of the persistence with which he exacted payment there can be
    no doubt whatever. Five years later, when the opposition between the two governments
    became more decided, he asked for an increase of his payments, and demanded that they
    should be made in large sums as each piece of information was given."</p>

    <p>At the same time it appears highly probable that he was similarly in the pay of
    France. <i>Ibid.</i></p>

    <p class="ni"><sup><a name="FN49" id="FN49"></a><a href="#FN49A">[49]</a></sup> The

    <p>A marginal note explains that these were, "Richard Duke of Gloster, and Robert
    Earl of Salisburie;" the anagram, of which title is "A silie burs." He also styles
    the late minister a monkey (<i>cercopithecus</i>) and hobgoblin (<i>empusa</i>).</p>

    <p>Oldmixon (<i>History of Queen Elizabeth</i>, p. 620) says of the Earl of Essex,
    "'Twas not likely that Cecil, whose Soul was of a narrow Size, and had no Room for
    enlarged Sentiments of Ambition, Glory, and Public Spirit, should cease to undermine

    Against Northumberland nothing was proved (<i>vide</i> de la Boderie,
    <i>Ambassade</i>, i. 178), except that he had admitted Thomas Percy amongst the royal
    pensioners without exacting the usual oath. He in vain demanded an open trial, but
    was prosecuted in the Star Chamber, and there sentenced to a fine of &pound;30,000
    (equal to at least ten times that sum in our money), and to be imprisoned for
    life.</p>

    <p>Mr. Gardiner considers that, in regard both of Raleigh and of Northumberland,
    Cecil acted with great moderation. It must, however, be remembered that in his secret
    correspondence with King James, before the death of the queen, he had strenuously
    endeavoured to poison the mind of that monarch against these his rivals. Thus he
    wrote, December 4th, 1601 (as usual through Lord Henry Howard): "You must remember
    that I gave you notice of the diabolical triplicity, that is, Cobham, Raleigh, and
    Northumberland, that met every day at Durham-house, where Raleigh lies, in
    consultation, which awaked all the best wits of the town ... to watch what chickens
    they could hatch out of these cockatrice eggs that were daily and nightly sitten on."
    (<i>Secret Correspondence of Sir Robert Cecil with James VI., King of Scotland</i>,
    Edinburgh, 1766, p. 29.) Coming after this, the speedy ruin of all these men appears
    highly suspicious.</p>

    <p class="ni"><sup><a name="FN58" id="FN58"></a><a href="#FN58A">[58]</a></sup> Sir
    Walter Cope in his <i>Apology</i> (Gutch, <i>Collectanea Curiosa</i>, i. No. 10)
    says: "When living, the world observed with all admiration and applause; no sooner
    dead, but it seeketh finally to suppress his excellent parts, and load his memory
    with all imputations of corruption."</p>

    <p>Among such charges are enumerated "His Falsehood in Friendship.&mdash;That he
    often made his friends fair promises, and underhand laid rubs to hinder their
    preferment.&mdash;The secret passage of things I know not.... Great Counsellors have
    their private and their publique ends...." etc.</p>

    <p class="ni"><sup><a name="FN59" id="FN59"></a><a href="#FN59A">[59]</a></sup> Lord
    Castlemaine after mentioning the chief features of the Gunpowder Plot, goes on: "But
    let it not displease you, if we ask whether Ulysses be no better known?"
    (<i>Catholique Apology</i>, p. 30.)</p>

    <p>Francis Herring in his Latin poem, <i>Pietas Pontificia</i> (published 1606),
    speaking of Monteagle (called "Morleius," from his father's title), who took the
    celebrated letter to Cecil, writes thus:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p class="ni">"Morleius Regis de consultoribus unum,<br />
      (Quem norat veteri nil quicquam cedere Ulyssi,<br />
      Juditio pollentem acri, ingenioque sagaci)<br />

    </blockquote>

    <p class="ni"><sup><a name="FN60" id="FN60"></a><a href="#FN60A">[60]</a></sup> This
    is so evident that it appears unnecessary to occupy space with proofs in detail. De
    la Boderie remarks (<i>Ambassade</i>, i. 71) on the extraordinary rancour of the
    minister against Catholics, and especially against Jesuits, and that "he wishes to
    destroy them everywhere." Of this a remarkable confirmation is afforded by the
    instructions given to Sir Thomas Parry when he was sent as ambassador, "Leiger," to
    Paris, in 1603, at the head of which stood these extraordinary articles:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>"To intimate to the French king the jealousy conceived in England upon the
      revocation of the Jesuits, against former edicts.</li>

      <li>"To inform the French king that the English were disgusted at the maintenance
      allowed to the French king's prelates and clergy, to priests and Jesuits that
      passed out of his dominions into England, Scotland, and Ireland, to do bad
      offices." (P.R.O. <i>France</i>, bundle 132, f. 314.)</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="ni"><sup><a name="FN61" id="FN61"></a><a href="#FN61A">[61]</a></sup>
    Jardine, <i>Gunpowder Plot</i>, p. 5. Strype says of the time of Elizabeth: "The
    faction of the Catholics in England is great, and able, if the kingdom were divided
    into three parts, to make two of them." (<i>Annals</i>, iii. 313, quoted by Butler,
    <i>Historical Memoirs</i>, ii. 177.)</p>

    <p>At the execution of Father Oldcorne, 1606, a proof was given of their numbers
    which is said to have alarmed the king greatly. The Father having from the scaffold
    invited all Catholics to pray with him, almost all present uncovered.</p>

    <p class="ni"><sup><a name="FN62" id="FN62"></a><a href="#FN62A">[62]</a></sup> Of
    this there can be no doubt, in spite of James's subsequent denial. Father Garnet
    wrote to Parsons (April 16th, 1603): "There hath happened a great alteration by the
    death of the Queen. Great fears were, but all are turned into greatest security, and
    a golden time we have of unexpected freedom abroade.... The Catholicks have great
    cause to hope for great respect, in that the nobility all almost labour for it, and
    have good promise thereof from his Majesty." (Stonyhurst MSS. <i>Anglia</i>, iii.
    32.)</p>

    Catholic conversions spread a panic which showed itself in an Act of the Parliament
    of 1604 confirming the statutes of Elizabeth; and to this James gave his assent. He
    promised, indeed, that the statute should remain inoperative." In May, 1604, the
    Catholics boasted that they had been joined by 10,000 converts. (Gardiner,

    Salisbury, in reward of his services on this occasion, received the Garter, May 20th,
    1606, and was honoured on the occasion with an almost regal triumph.</p>

    <p>Of the proceedings subsequent to the Plot we are told: "In passing these laws for
    the security of the Protestant Religion, the Earl of Salisbury exerted himself with
    distinguished zeal and vigour, which gained him great love and honour from the
    kingdom, as appeared in some measure, in the universal attendance on him at his
    installation with the Order of the Garter, on the 20th of May, 1606, at Windsor."
    (Birch, <i>Historical View</i>, p. 256.)</p>

    <p class="ni"><sup><a name="FN71" id="FN71"></a><a href="#FN71A">[71]</a></sup> This
    belief is so notorious that one instance must suffice as evidence for it. A paper of
    informations addressed to Cecil himself, April, 1604, declares that the Catholics
    hoped to see a good day yet, and that "his Majesty would suffer a kinde of
    Tolleracyon, for his inclynacyon is good, howsoever the Councell set out his
    speeches." (S.P.O. <i>Dom. James I.</i> vii. 86.)</p>

    were. (<i>Narrative of the Gunpowder Plot</i>, ed. Morris, p. 62.)</p>

    Camden, the historian, to Sir R. Cotton, March 15th, 1596. (Birch, <i>Original
    Letters</i>, 2nd series, iii. p. 179.) Various writers erroneously suppose this
    transaction to have occurred in March, 1603, on occasion of Elizabeth's last illness.
    The correct date, 1596, given by Sir Henry Ellis, is supplied by a statement
    contained in the letter, that this was her Majesty's "climacterick year," that is,
    her sixty-third, this number, as the multiple of the potent factors seven and nine,
    being held of prime importance in human life. Elizabeth was born in 1533.</p>

    <p>From Garnet's examination of March 14th, 1605-6 (<i>Dom. James I.</i> xix. 44), we
    learn that Catesby was at large at the time of the queen's demise.</p>

    <p class="ni"><sup><a name="FN86" id="FN86"></a><a href="#FN86A">[86]</a></sup>
    Catesby purchased his life for a fine of 4,000 marks, and Tresham of 3,000. Mr.
    Jessopp says that the former sum is equivalent at least to &pound;30,000 at the
    present day. (<i>Dict. Nat. Biog., Catesby</i>.)</p>

    they brought store of help with them." (<i>Narrative of the Gunpowder Plot</i>, p.

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

  <h3>THE OPINION OF CONTEMPORARIES AND HISTORIANS.</h3>

  <p class="ni"><span class="smcap">We</span> have now for so long a period been
  accustomed to accept the official story regarding the Gunpowder Plot, that most readers
  will be surprised to hear that at the time of its occurrence, and for more than a
  century afterwards, there were, to say the least, many intelligent men who took for
  granted that in some way or other the actual conspirators were but the dupes and
  instruments of more crafty men than themselves, and in their mad enterprise unwittingly
  played the game of ministers of State.</p>

  <p>From the beginning the government itself anticipated this, as is evidenced by the
  careful and elaborate account of the whole affair drawn up on the 7th of November,
  1605&mdash;two days after the "discovery"&mdash;seemingly for the benefit of the Privy
  Council.<sup><a name="FN99A" id="FN99A"></a><a href="#FN99">[99]</a></sup> This
  important document, which is in the handwriting of Levinus Munck, Cecil's secretary,
  with numerous and significant emendations from the hand of Cecil himself, speaks,
  amongst other things, of the need of circumspection, "considering how apt the world is
  nowadays to think all providence and intelligences to <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>be but practices." The result did not falsify
  the expectation. Within five weeks we find a letter written from London to a
  correspondent abroad,<sup><a name="FN100A" id="FN100A"></a><a href=
  "#FN100">[100]</a></sup> wherein it is said: "Those that have practical experience of
  the way in which things are done, hold it as certain that there has been foul play, and
  that some of the Council secretly spun the web to entangle these poor gentlemen, as did
  Secretary Walsingham in other cases," and it is clear that the writer has but recorded
  an opinion widely prevalent. To this the government again bear witness, for they found
  it advisable to issue an official version of the history, in the <i>True and Perfect
  Relation</i>, and the <i>Discourse of the Manner of the Discovery of the Gunpowder
  Plot</i>, the appearance of which was justified expressly on the ground that "there do
  pass from hand to hand divers uncertain, untrue, and incoherent reports and relations,"
  and that it is very important "for men to understand the birth and growth of the said
  abominable and detestable conspiracy." The accounts published with this object are, by
  the common consent of historians, flagrantly untruthful and untrustworthy.<sup><a name=
  "FN101A" id="FN101A"></a><a href="#FN101">[101]</a></sup> <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>We likewise find Secretary
  Cecil writing to instruct Sir E. Coke, the Attorney-General, as to his conduct of the
  case against the conspirators, in view of the "lewd" reports current in regard of the
  manner in which it had been discovered.<sup><a name="FN102A" id="FN102A"></a><a href=
  "#FN102">[102]</a></sup> The same minister, in the curious political manifesto which he
  issued in connection with the affair,<sup><a name="FN103A" id="FN103A"></a><a href=
  "#FN103">[103]</a></sup> again bears witness to the same effect, when he declares that
  the papists, after the manner of Nero, were throwing the blame of their crime upon
  others.</p>

  <p>Clearly, however, it was not to the papists alone that such an explanation commended
  itself. The Puritan Osborne<sup><a name="FN104A" id="FN104A"></a><a href=
  "#FN104">[104]</a></sup> speaks of the manner in which the "discovery" was managed as
  "a neat device of the Treasurer's, he being very plentiful in such plots." Goodman,
  Anglican Bishop of Gloucester, another contemporary, is even more explicit. After
  describing the indignation of the Catholics when they found themselves deceived in
  their hopes at the hands of James, he goes on: "The great statesman had intelligence of
  all this, and because he would show his service to the State, he would first contrive
  and then discover a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg
  45]</a></span>treason, and the more odious and hateful the treason were, his service
  would be the greater and the more acceptable."<sup><a name="FN105A" id=
  "FN105A"></a><a href="#FN105">[105]</a></sup> Another notable witness is quoted by the
  Jesuit Father Martin Grene, in a letter to his brother Christopher, January 1st,
  1665-6:<sup><a name="FN106A" id="FN106A"></a><a href="#FN106">[106]</a></sup> "I have
  heard strange things, which, if ever I can make out, will be very pertinent: for
  certain, the late Bishop of Armagh, Usher, was divers times heard to say, that if
  papists knew what he knew, the blame of the Gunpowder Treason would not lie on them."
  In like manner we find it frequently asserted on the authority of Lord Cobham and
  others,<sup><a name="FN107A" id="FN107A"></a><a href="#FN107">[107]</a></sup> that King
  James himself, when he had time to realize the truth of the matter, was in the habit of
  speaking of the Fifth of November as "Cecil's holiday."</p>

  <p>Such a belief must have been widely entertained, otherwise it could not have been
  handed on, as it was, for generations. It is not too much to say that historians for
  almost a century and a half, if they did not themselves favour the theory of the
  government's complicity, at least bore witness how widely that idea prevailed. Thus, to
  confine ourselves at present to Protestant writers, Sanderson,<sup><a name="FN108A" id=
  "FN108A"></a><a href="#FN108">[108]</a></sup> acknowledging that the secretary was
  accused of having manipulated the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id=
  "Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>transaction, says no word to indicate that he repudiates
  such a charge. Welwood<sup><a name="FN109A" id="FN109A"></a><a href=
  "#FN109">[109]</a></sup> is of opinion that Cecil was aware of the Plot long before the
  "discovery," and that the famous letter to Monteagle was "a contrivance of his own."
  Oldmixon writes<sup><a name="FN110A" id="FN110A"></a><a href="#FN110">[110]</a></sup>
  "notwithstanding the general joy, ... there were some who insinuated that the Plot was
  of the King's own making, or that he was privy to it from first to last."
  Carte<sup><a name="FN111A" id="FN111A"></a><a href="#FN111">[111]</a></sup> does not
  believe that James knew anything of it, but considers it "not improbable" that Cecil
  was better informed. Burnet<sup><a name="FN112A" id="FN112A"></a><a href=
  "#FN112">[112]</a></sup> complains of the impudence of the papists of his day, who
  denied the conspiracy, and pretended it was an artifice of the minister's "to engage
  some desperate men into a plot, which he managed so that he could discover it when he
  pleased." Fuller<sup><a name="FN113A" id="FN113A"></a><a href="#FN113">[113]</a></sup>
  bears witness to the general belief, but considers it inconsistent with the well-known
  piety of King James. Bishop Kennet, in his Fifth of November sermon at St. Paul's, in
  1715, talks in a similar strain. So extreme, indeed, does the incredulity and
  uncertainty appear to have been, that the Puritan Prynne<sup><a name="FN114A" id=
  "FN114A"></a><a href="#FN114">[114]</a></sup> is inclined to suspect Bancroft, the
  Archbishop of Canterbury, of having been engaged in the conspiracy; while one of the
  furious zealots who followed the lead of Titus Oates, mournfully testified that there
  were those in his day who looked upon the Powder Treason "as upon a romantic
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>story, or a
  politic invention, or a State trick," giving no more credence to it than to the
  histories of the "Grand Cyrus, or Guy of Warwick, or Amadis de Gaul,"&mdash;or, as we
  should now say, Jack the Giant Killer.</p>

  <p>The general scope and drift of such suspicions are well indicated by Bevil Higgons,
  "This impious design," he writes<sup><a name="FN115A" id="FN115A"></a><a href=
  "#FN115">[115]</a></sup> of the Plot, "gave the greatest blow to the Catholic interest
  in England, by rendering that religion so odious to the people. The common opinion
  concerning the discovery of the Plot, by a letter to the Lord Mounteagle, has not been
  universally allowed to be the real truth of the matter, for some have affirmed that
  this design was first hammered in the forge of Cecil, who intended to have produced
  this plot in the time of Queen Elizabeth, but prevented by her death he resumed his
  project in this reign, with a design to have so enraged the nation as to have expelled
  all Roman Catholics, and confiscated their estates. To this end, by his secret
  emissaries, he enticed some hot-headed men of that persuasion, who, ignorant whence the
  design first came, heartily engaged in this execrable Powder Treason.... Though this
  account should not be true," he continues, "it is certain that the Court of England had
  notice of this Plot from France and Italy long before the pretended discovery; upon
  which Cecil ... framed that letter to the Lord Mounteagle, with a design to make the
  discovery seem the more miraculous, and at the same time magnify the judgment of the
  king, who by his deep penetration was to have the honour of unravelling so ambiguous
  and dark a riddle."</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

  <p>It may be added that amongst modern historians who have given special attention to
  this period, several, though repudiating the notion that Cecil originated the Plot, are
  strongly of opinion that as to the important episode of the "discovery," the
  traditional story is a fabrication. Thus, Mr. Brewer<sup><a name="FN116A" id=
  "FN116A"></a><a href="#FN116">[116]</a></sup> declares it to be quite certain that
  Cecil had previous knowledge of the design, and that the "discovery" was a fraud.
  Lodge<sup><a name="FN117A" id="FN117A"></a><a href="#FN117">[117]</a></sup> is of the
  same opinion, and so is the author of the <i>Annals of England</i>.<sup><a name=
  "FN118A" id="FN118A"></a><a href="#FN118">[118]</a></sup> Jardine<sup><a name="FN119A"
  id="FN119A"></a><a href="#FN119">[119]</a></sup> inclines to the belief that the
  government contrived the letter to Monteagle in order to conceal the means by which
  their information had in reality been obtained. Mr. Gardiner, though dismissing the
  idea as "absurd," acknowledges that his contemporaries accused Cecil of inventing the
  whole Plot.<sup><a name="FN120A" id="FN120A"></a><a href="#FN120">[120]</a></sup></p>

  <p>So much for the testimony of Protestants. As for those who had to suffer in
  consequence of the affair, there is no need to multiply testimonies. Lord Castlemaine
  tells us<sup><a name="FN121A" id="FN121A"></a><a href="#FN121">[121]</a></sup> that
  "the Catholics of England, who knew Cecil's ways of acting and their own innocence,
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>suspected him
  from the beginning, as hundreds still alive can testify." Father Henry More, S.J., a
  contemporary, speaks to the same effect.<sup><a name="FN122A" id="FN122A"></a><a href=
  "#FN122">[122]</a></sup> Father John Gerard, who was not only a contemporary, but one
  of those accused of complicity, intimates<sup><a name="FN123A" id="FN123A"></a><a href=
  "#FN123">[123]</a></sup> his utter disbelief of the official narrative concerning the
  discovery, and his conviction that those who had the scanning of the redoubtable letter
  were "well able in shorter time and with fewer doubts to decipher a darker riddle and
  find out a greater secret than that matter was." One Floyde, a spy, testified in
  1615<sup><a name="FN124A" id="FN124A"></a><a href="#FN124">[124]</a></sup> to having
  frequently heard various Jesuits say, that the government were aware of the Plot
  several months before they thought fit to "discover" it.</p>

  <p>The Catholic view is expressed with much point and force by an anonymous writer of
  the eighteenth century:<sup><a name="FN125A" id="FN125A"></a><a href=
  "#FN125">[125]</a></sup> "I shall touch briefly upon a few particulars relating to this
  Plot, for the happy discovery whereof an anniversary holiday has now been kept for
  above a hundred years. Is it out of pure gratitude to God the nation is so particularly
  devout on this occasion? If so, it is highly commendable: for we ought to thank God for
  all things, and therefore I cannot deny but there is all the reason in the world to
  give him solemn thanks, for that the king and Parliament never were in any danger of
  being hurt by the Powder Plot.... I am far from denying the Gunpowder Plot. Nay, I
  believe as firmly that Catesby, with twelve more popish associates, had <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>a design to blow up K.
  James, as I believe that the father of that same king was effectually blown up by the
  Earls of Murray, Morton, Bothwell, and others of the Reformed Church of Scotland.
  However ... I humbly conceive I may say the king and Parliament were in no danger of
  being hurt by it, and my reason is because they had not less a man than the prime
  minister of state for their tutelar angel; a person deeply read in politics; who had
  inherited the double spirit of his predecessor Walsingham, knew all his tricks of
  legerdemain, and could as seasonably discover plots as contrive them.... This much at
  least is certain, that the letter written to my Lord Mounteagle, by which the Plot was
  discovered, had not a fool, but a very wise sophister for its author: for it was so
  craftily worded, that though it was mysterious enough on the one hand to prevent a full
  evidence that it was written on purpose to discover the Plot, yet it was clear enough
  on the other to be understood with the help of a little consideration, as the event
  soon showed. Indeed, when it was brought to Secretary Cecil, he, poor gentleman, had
  not penetration enough to understand the meaning of it, and said it was certainly
  written by a madman. But there, I fear, he wronged himself. For the secretary was no
  madman. On the contrary, he had too much wit to explain it himself, and was too refined
  a politician to let slip so favourable an occasion of making his court to the king, who
  was to have the compliment made him of being the only Solomon wise enough to unfold
  this dark mystery. Which while his Majesty was doing with a great deal of ease, the
  secretary was all the while at his elbow admiring and applauding his <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>wonderful sagacity.... So
  that, in all probability, the same man was the chief underhand contriver and discoverer
  of the Plot; and the greatest part of the bubbles concerned in it were trapanned into
  it by one who took sure care that none but themselves should be hurt by it.... But be
  that as it will, there is no doubt but that they who suffer themselves to be drawn into
  a plot like fools, deserve to be hanged for it like knaves."</p>

  <p>The opinion of Dodd, the historian, has already been indicated, which in another
  place he thus emphasizes and explains:<sup><a name="FN126A" id="FN126A"></a><a href=
  "#FN126">[126]</a></sup> "Some persons in chief power suspecting the king would be very
  indulgent to Catholics, several stratagems were made use of to exasperate him against
  them, and cherishing the Gunpowder Plot is thought to be a masterpiece in this
  way."<sup><a name="FN127A" id="FN127A"></a><a href="#FN127">[127]</a></sup></p>

  <p>It would not be difficult to continue similar citations, but enough has now been
  said to show that it is nothing new to charge the chief minister of James I. with
  having fostered the conspiracy for his own purposes, or even to have actually set it
  a-going. It appears perfectly clear that from the first there were <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>not a few, and those not
  Catholics only, who entertained such a belief, and that the facts of the case are
  inadequately represented by historians, who imply, like Mr. Jardine, that such a theory
  was first broached long afterwards, and adopted by Catholics alone.<sup><a name=
  "FN128A" id="FN128A"></a><a href="#FN128">[128]</a></sup></p>

  <p>It is moreover apparent that if in recent times historians have forgotten that such
  a view was ever held, or consider it too preposterous for serious discussion, this is
  not because fuller knowledge of the details of the conspiracy have discredited it. The
  official version of the story has remained in possession of the field, and it has
  gradually been assumed that this must substantially be true. In consequence, as it
  seems, writers of history, approaching the subject with this conviction, have failed to
  remark many points suggested even by the documentary evidence at our disposal, and
  still more emphatically by the recorded facts, which cannot but throw grave doubt upon
  almost every particular of the traditional account, while making it impossible to
  believe that, as to what is most essential, the Plot was in reality what has for so
  long been supposed. That long before the "discovery" the Plot must have been, and in
  fact was, known to the government; that this knowledge was artfully dissimulated, in
  order to make political capital <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id=
  "Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>out of it; that for the same purpose the sensational
  circumstances of its discovery were deliberately arranged; and that there are grave
  reasons for suspecting the beginnings of the desperate enterprise, as well as its
  catastrophe, to have been dexterously manipulated for State purposes;&mdash;such are
  the conclusions, the evidence for which will now be considered.</p>

    The author of the <i>English Protestants' Plea</i> (1621) says: "Old stratagems and
    tragedies of Queene Elizabeth's time must needs be renewed and playde againe, to
    bring not only the Catholikes of England, but their holy religion into obloquy" (p.

    writes: "That Cecil was the contriver, or at least the fomenter of [the Plot,] was

    by name Master Buck, two months before, of a wicked designe his Master had against

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

  <h3>THE TRADITIONAL STORY.</h3>

  <p class="ni"><span class="smcap">The</span> history of the Gunpowder Plot prior to its
  discovery, as related with much circumstantiality by the government of the day, has, in
  all essential particulars, been accepted without demur by the great majority of modern
  writers. We have already seen that those who lived nearer to the period in question
  were less easily convinced; it remains to show that the internal evidence of the story
  itself is incompatible with its truthfulness.</p>

  <p>The point upon which everything turns is the secret, and therefore dangerous,
  character of the conspiracy, which, as we are told, completely eluded the vigilance of
  the authorities, and was on the very verge of success before even a breath of suspicion
  was aroused, being balked only by a lucky accident occurring at the eleventh hour, in a
  manner fitly described as miraculous.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, however, many plain and obvious considerations combine to show
  that such an account cannot be true. It is not easy to believe that much which is said
  to have been done by the conspirators ever occurred at all. It is clear that, if such
  things did occur, they can by no possibility have escaped observation. There is
  evidence that the government knew of the Plot long before they suddenly "discovered"
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>it. Finally, the
  story of the said "discovery," and the manner in which it took place, is plainly not
  only untrue, but devised to conceal the truth; while the elaborate care expended upon
  it sufficiently indicates how important it was held that the truth should be
  concealed.</p>

  <p>There are, moreover, arguments, which appear to deserve consideration, suggesting
  the conclusion that the Plot was actually set on foot by the secret instigation of
  those who designed to make it serve their ends, as in fact it did. For our purpose,
  however, it is not necessary to insist greatly upon these. It will be enough to show
  that, whatever its origin, the conspiracy was, and must have been, known to those in
  power, who, playing with their infatuated dupes, allowed them to go on with their mad
  scheme, till the moment came to strike with full effect; thus impressing the nation
  with a profound sense of its marvellous deliverance, and winning its confidence for
  those to whose vigilance and sagacity alone that deliverance appeared due.</p>

  <p>That we may rightly follow the details of the story told to us, we must in the first
  place understand the topography of the scene of operations, which, with the aid of the
  illustrations given, will not be difficult.</p>

  <p>The old House of Lords<sup><a name="FN129A" id="FN129A"></a><a href=
  "#FN129">[129]</a></sup> was a chamber occupying the first floor of a building which
  stood about fifty yards from the left bank of the Thames, to which it was parallel, the
  stream at this point running almost due north. Beneath the Peers' Chamber, on the
  ground floor, was a large room, which plays an important part in our history. This had
  originally served as the palace kitchen,<sup><a name="FN130A" id="FN130A"></a><a href=
  "#FN130">[130]</a></sup> and though commonly described as a "cellar" or a "vault" was
  in reality neither, for it stood on the level of the ground outside, and had a flat
  ceiling, formed by the beams which supported the flooring of the Lords' apartment
  above.<sup><a name="FN131A" id="FN131A"></a><a href="#FN131">[131]</a></sup> It ran
  beneath the said Peers' Chamber from end to end, and measured 77 feet in length, by 24
  feet 4 inches in width.</p>

  <p>At either end, the building abutted upon another running transversely to it; that on
  the north being the "Painted Chamber," probably erected by Edward the Confessor, and
  that on the south the "Prince's <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id=
  "Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>Chamber," assigned by its architectural features to the
  reign of Henry III. The former served as a place of conference for Lords and
  Commons,<sup><a name="FN132A" id="FN132A"></a><a href="#FN132">[132]</a></sup> the
  latter as the robing-room of the Lords. The royal throne stood at the south end of the
  House, near the Prince's Chamber.</p>

    "495" alt="GROUND PLAN OF THE SCENE OF ACTION." title="" /> <span class=
    "caption"><span class="smcap">ground plan of the scene of action.</span></span>
  </div>

  <p>Originally the Parliament Chamber and the "cellar" beneath it were lighted by large
  windows on both sides; subsequently, houses raised against it <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>blocked these up, and the
  Lords were supplied with light by dormers constructed in the roof. The walls of their
  apartment were then hung with tapestry, representing the defeat of the Spanish Armada.
  Although precise information on the point is not easy to obtain, it would appear that
  this did not occur till a period later than that with which we are
  concerned.<sup><a name="FN133A" id="FN133A"></a><a href="#FN133">[133]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Such was the position to be attacked. As a first step, the conspirators resolved to
  hire a house in the immediate neighbourhood, to serve them as a base of operations.
  Thomas Percy was selected to appear as the principal in this part of the business, for,
  being one of the king's pensioners, he had frequently to be in attendance at Court, and
  might naturally wish to have a lodging close at hand. The house chosen was one, or
  rather a part of one,<sup><a name="FN134A" id="FN134A"></a><a href=
  "#FN134">[134]</a></sup> standing near the Prince's Chamber, and on the side towards
  the river.<sup><a name="FN135A" id="FN135A"></a><a href="#FN135">[135]</a></sup></p>

  <p>In treating for the lease of this tenement Percy seems to have conducted himself in
  a manner altogether different from what we might have expected of one whose object
  required him, above all, to avoid <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id=
  "Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>attracting notice. He appears, in fact, to have made the
  greatest possible ado about the business. The apartments were already let to one
  Ferrers, who was unwilling to give them up, and Percy eventually succeeded in his
  purpose, after not only "long suit by himself," but also "great intreaty of Mr.
  Carleton, Mr. Epsley, and other gentlemen belonging to the Earl of
  Northumberland."<sup><a name="FN136A" id="FN136A"></a><a href="#FN136">[136]</a></sup>
  These gentlemen were never said to have been privy to the Conspiracy, and one of them,
  the well-known Dudley Carleton, afterwards Viscount Dorchester, was not only at this
  time secretary to Sir <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg
  62]</a></span>Thomas Parry, the Ambassador in France, but was "patronised" by Cecil
  himself.<sup><a name="FN137A" id="FN137A"></a><a href="#FN137">[137]</a></sup></p>

    title="" /> <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">the old house of lords, from
    the east or river side, showing the garden.</span></span>
  </div>

  <p>Neither does the house appear to have been well suited to serve the purposes for
  which it was taken. Speed tells us,<sup><a name="FN138A" id="FN138A"></a><a href=
  "#FN138">[138]</a></sup> and he is confirmed by Bishop Barlow of Lincoln,<sup><a name=
  "FN139A" id="FN139A"></a><a href="#FN139">[139]</a></sup> that it was let out to
  tenants only when Parliament was not assembled, and during a session formed part of the
  premises at the disposal of the Lords, whom it served as a withdrawing room. As the
  Plot was, of necessity, to take effect during a session,<sup><a name="FN140A" id=
  "FN140A"></a><a href="#FN140">[140]</a></sup> when the place would thus be in other
  hands, it is very hard to understand how it was intended that the final and all
  important operation should be conducted.</p>

  <p>The bargain for the house was concluded May 24th, 1604,<sup><a name="FN141A" id=
  "FN141A"></a><a href="#FN141">[141]</a></sup> but the proposed operations were delayed
  till a much later date, by a circumstance which clearly shows the public nature of the
  premises, and that the lease obtained conferred no exclusive right of occupation. The
  question of a union with Scotland, for which King James was very anxious, was at the
  time being agitated, and commissioners having been appointed to discuss it, this very
  house was placed at their disposal for their meetings. Consequently the <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>summer and autumn passed
  without any farther steps being taken by the conspirators.</p>

  <p>At last, in December, they were free to take in hand the extraordinary scheme they
  had matured. This was, starting from a cellar of Percy's house,<sup><a name="FN142A"
  id="FN142A"></a><a href="#FN142">[142]</a></sup> to dig thence an underground mine to
  the foundations of the Parliament House, and through them; and then to construct
  within, beneath the Peers' Chamber itself, a "concavity" large enough to contain the
  amount of powder requisite for their purpose. On December 11th, 1604, they commenced
  operations,<sup><a name="FN143A" id="FN143A"></a><a href="#FN143">[143]</a></sup> and
  in a fortnight, that is by Christmas, they had tunnelled from their starting-point to
  the wall they had to breach; and that this first operation was of no small magnitude,
  especially for men who had never before handled pick or shovel,<sup><a name="FN144A"
  id="FN144A"></a><a href="#FN144">[144]</a></sup> is shown by the fact that what they
  contrived to do in so short a time was quoted as evidence of the extraordinary zeal
  they displayed in their nefarious enterprise.<sup><a name="FN145A" id=
  "FN145A"></a><a href="#FN145">[145]</a></sup> Having rested a little, for <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>the Christmas holidays, they
  began upon the wall, which presented an unexpected obstacle. They found that it was not
  only "very hard to beat through," but, moreover, nine feet thick, though since, as we
  shall see, they never penetrated to the other side, it is not clear how they were able
  to measure it.<sup><a name="FN146A" id="FN146A"></a><a href="#FN146">[146]</a></sup> Up
  to this point but five persons had engaged in the work, Catesby, Percy, Thomas Winter,
  John Wright, and Faukes. In consequence however of the difficulties now experienced,
  Keyes was called in to their aid. He had already been initiated in the Plot, and
  appointed to take charge of the powder, which was being accumulated and stored in a
  house hired for the purpose across the Thames, at Lambeth. It was therefore necessary
  to bring over the powder with him, which amounted at this time to twenty barrels, and
  was placed either in Percy's lodging itself, or in an outhouse belonging to it. About
  the same time Christopher Wright was also initiated and took his share of the
  labour.<sup><a name="FN147A" id="FN147A"></a><a href="#FN147">[147]</a></sup></p>

  <p>The gang thus composed laboured upon the wall from the beginning of January, 1604-5,
  to the middle of March,<sup><a name="FN148A" id="FN148A"></a><a href=
  "#FN148">[148]</a></sup> by which time they had succeeded in getting <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>only half way through. While
  the others worked, Faukes stood on sentry to warn them of any danger.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, it must be asked how proceedings so remarkable could have escaped the
  notice, not only of the government, but of the entire neighbourhood. This, it must be
  remembered, was most populous. There were people living in the very building, a part of
  which sheltered the conspirators. Around, were thickly clustered the dwellings of the
  keeper of the Wardrobe, auditors and tellers of the Exchequer, and other such
  officials.<sup><a name="FN149A" id="FN149A"></a><a href="#FN149">[149]</a></sup> There
  were tradespeople and workmen constantly employed close to the spot where the work was
  going on; while the public character of the place makes it impossible to suppose that
  tenants such as Percy and his friends, who were little better than lodgers, could claim
  the exclusive use of anything beyond the rooms they rented&mdash;even when allowed the
  use of these&mdash;or could shut against the neighbours and visitors in general the
  precincts of so much frequented a spot.</p>

  <p>How, then, did they dispose of the mass of soil dug out in making a tunnel through
  which barrels and hogsheads were to be conveyed? No man who has had practical
  experience of the unexpected quantity of earth which comes out of the most <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>insignificant excavation,
  will be likely to rest satisfied with the explanation officially given, that it was
  sufficiently concealed by being hidden beneath the turf in the little garden
  adjoining.<sup><a name="FN150A" id="FN150A"></a><a href="#FN150">[150]</a></sup> What,
  moreover, was done with the great stones that came out of the foundations? Of these
  there must have been on hand at least some sixty cubic feet, probably much more, and
  they, at any rate, can scarcely have been stowed away beneath the turf.</p>

  <p>What, above all, of the noise made during the space of a couple of months, in
  assaulting a wall "very hard to beat through"? It is a matter of common observation how
  sound travels in the ground, and every stroke of the pick upon the stone must have been
  distinctly heard for more than a hundred yards all around, constituting a public
  nuisance. Meanwhile, not only were there people living close by on every side, but men
  were constantly at work right over the heads of the diggers, and only a few feet from
  them: yet we are required to believe that neither these nor any others had any notion
  that anything unusual was going on.</p>

  <p>Neither is it easy to understand how these amateurs contrived to do so much without
  a catastrophe. To make a tunnel through soft earth is a very delicate operation,
  replete with unlooked-for difficulties. To shore up the roof and sides there must,
  moreover, have been required a large quantity of the "framed timber" of which Speed
  tells us, and the provision and importation of this must have been almost as hard to
  keep dark as the exportation of the earth and stones. A <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>still more critical operation is that of
  meddling with the foundations of a house&mdash;especially of an old and heavy
  structure&mdash;which a professional craftsman would not venture upon except with
  extreme care, and the employment of many precautions of which these light-hearted
  adventurers knew nothing. Yet, recklessly breaking their way out of one building, and
  to a large extent into another, they appear to have occasioned neither crack nor
  settlement in either.</p>

  <p>We are by no means at the end of our difficulties. According to the tale told by
  Faukes,<sup><a name="FN151A" id="FN151A"></a><a href="#FN151">[151]</a></sup> all the
  seven miners "lay in Percy's house," never showing themselves while the work was in
  progress. This circumstance, to say nothing of the storage of powder barrels and
  timber, seems to imply that the premises were spacious and commodious. We learn,
  however, on the unimpeachable evidence of Mrs. Whynniard's servant,<sup><a name=
  "FN152A" id="FN152A"></a><a href="#FN152">[152]</a></sup> that the house afforded
  accommodation only for one person at a time, so that when Percy came there to spend the
  night, Faukes, who passed for his man, had to lodge out. This suggests another
  question. Percy's pretext for laying in so much fuel was that he meant to bring up his
  wife to live there. But how could this be under such conditions?</p>

  <p>Still more serious is another problem. When the mining operations were commenced, in
  December, 1604, Parliament was appointed to meet on the 7th of February following, by
  which time, as is evident, the preparations of the conspirators could not have been
  completed. While they were working, however, news came that the session was to be
  postponed till October. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg
  68]</a></span>This information the conspirators appear to have received quite casually
  before Christmas, for it is said that on the strength of it, they thought they could
  afford to take a holiday.<sup><a name="FN153A" id="FN153A"></a><a href=
  "#FN153">[153]</a></sup> Early in January they were again at work,<sup><a name="FN154A"
  id="FN154A"></a><a href="#FN154">[154]</a></sup> and they continued their operations
  thenceforth, without any circumstance intervening to interrupt or alarm them, of which
  we hear anything either from themselves or from subsequent writers. Nevertheless, it is
  quite certain that the Lords actually met on February 7th&mdash;that is while the
  mining operations were going on&mdash;and not only went through the ceremony of
  prorogation, but transacted some little business besides, Lord Denny being introduced
  and his writ of summons read.<sup><a name="FN155A" id="FN155A"></a><a href=
  "#FN155">[155]</a></sup> It is equally incomprehensible <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>that the miners should have known nothing of
  so startling an occurrence, or that knowing of it they should never have made the
  slightest mention thereof. It is even more difficult to explain how the Peers thus
  assembled, and their attendants, could have failed to remark the mine, then actually
  open, in premises belonging to themselves, or any suspicious features of earth, stones,
  timber, or barrels.</p>

  <p>The difficulties presented by the stubborn nature of the foundation-wall proved
  well-nigh insuperable, but, as is observed by Father Greenway,<sup><a name="FN156A" id=
  "FN156A"></a><a href="#FN156">[156]</a></sup> one still more grave awaited the diggers
  had they succeeded in making their way through. The "concavity" to be excavated within,
  to contain the large number of powder barrels required for their purpose, would have
  involved engineering work of the most hazardous kind, and heavily laden as the floor
  above proved to be, it must, according to all rules of calculation, have collapsed,
  when thus undermined. But at this juncture, when the wall had been half pierced, a
  circumstance occurred, not less extraordinary than others we have considered, to change
  the whole plan of operations.</p>

  <p>All this time, ridiculous as is the supposition, the conspirators appear to have
  been ignorant of the existence of the "cellar," and to have fancied that they were
  working their way immediately beneath the Chamber of the Peers.<sup><a name="FN157A"
  id="FN157A"></a><a href="#FN157">[157]</a></sup> If such a circumstance be <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>incredible, the consequences
  must be borne by the narrative of which it forms an essential feature. That it is
  incredible can hardly be questioned. The so-called "cellar," as we have seen, was a
  large and conspicuous room above ground. There are reasons for believing that it served
  habitually as a passage between the different parts of the palace. It appears certain
  that some of the conspirators, Percy in particular, as being one of his Majesty's
  pensioners, must have frequently been in the House of Lords itself, and therefore have
  known where it was; and clearly men of their position were able to attend there when
  they chose.<sup><a name="FN158A" id="FN158A"></a><a href="#FN158">[158]</a></sup></p>

  <p>The manner in which they came at last to discover the "cellar" is thus related by
  Mr. Jardine:<sup><a name="FN159A" id="FN159A"></a><a href="#FN159">[159]</a></sup> "One
  morning, while working upon the wall, they suddenly heard a rushing noise in a cellar,
  nearly above their heads. At first they imagined that they had been discovered; but
  Fawkes being despatched to reconnoitre, found that one Bright, to whom the cellar
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>belonged, was
  selling off his coals<sup><a name="FN160A" id="FN160A"></a><a href=
  "#FN160">[160]</a></sup> in order to remove, and that the noise proceeded from this
  cause. Fawkes <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg
  72]</a></span>carefully surveyed the place, which proved to be a large vault, situated
  immediately below the House of Lords, and extremely convenient for the purpose they had
  in view.... Finding that the cellar would shortly become vacant, the conspirators
  agreed that it should be hired in Percy's name, under the pretext that he wanted it for
  his own coals and wood. This was accordingly done, and immediate possession was
  obtained."<sup><a name="FN161A" id="FN161A"></a><a href="#FN161">[161]</a></sup></p>

  <div class="figcenter c7">

    "caption"><span class="smcap">cellar under house of lords.</span></span>
  </div>

  <p>It is obvious that Mr. Bright's men must on this, as presumably upon many previous
  occasions, have been at work among the coals, while the miners were hammering at the
  foundations beneath them, and yet have been as little aware of what was going on as
  were the others of the existence of the "cellar." It must, farther, be noted that the
  hiring of this receptacle was, in fact, by no means so easy a matter as the accounts
  ordinarily given would lead us to suppose. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id=
  "Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>Faukes, in the narrative on which the whole history of this
  episode has been based, is made to say that he found that the coals were a-selling, and
  the cellar was to be let, whereupon Percy went and hired it. Mrs. Whynniard, however,
  tells us that the cellar was not to let, and that Bright had not the disposal of the
  lease, but one Skinner, and that Percy "laboured very earnestly" before he succeeded in
  obtaining it.</p>

  </div>

  <p>But, whatever the circumstances and manner of the transaction, it appears that at
  Lady-day, 1605, this chamber came into the hands of those who were to make it so
  famous; whereupon, we are told, they resolved to abandon the mine, and use this
  ready-made <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg
  74]</a></span>cavity for their purposes. To it, accordingly, they transferred their
  powder, the barrels, by subsequent additions, being increased to thirty-six, and the
  amount to nine or ten thousand pounds.<sup><a name="FN162A" id="FN162A"></a><a href=
  "#FN162">[162]</a></sup> The casks were covered with firewood, 500 faggots and 3,000
  billets being brought in by hired porters and piled up by Faukes, to whose charge, in
  his assumed character of Percy's servant, the cellar was committed. It is stated in
  Winter's long declaration on this subject,<sup><a name="FN163A" id=
  "FN163A"></a><a href="#FN163">[163]</a></sup> that the barrels were thus completely
  hidden, "because we might have the house free, to suffer anyone to enter that would,"
  and we find it mentioned by various writers subsequently, that free ingress was
  actually allowed to the public. Thus we read<sup><a name="FN164A" id=
  "FN164A"></a><a href="#FN164">[164]</a></sup> of "the deep <span class=

  'pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>cunning [of the
  conspirators] in throwing open the vault, as if there had been nothing to conceal;"
  while another writer<sup><a name="FN165A" id="FN165A"></a><a href=
  "#FN165">[165]</a></sup> tells us, "The place was hired by Percy; 36 barrels of
  gunpowder were lodged in it; the whole covered up with billets and faggots; the doors
  of the cellar boldly flung open, and everybody admitted, as though it contained nothing
  dangerous." On the top of the barrels were likewise placed "great bars of iron and
  massy stones," in order "to make the breach the greater."</p>

  </div>

  <p>We may here pause to review the extraordinary story to which we have been listening.
  A group of men, known for as dangerous characters as any in England, men, in Cecil's
  own words,<sup><a name="FN166A" id="FN166A"></a><a href="#FN166">[166]</a></sup> "spent
  in their fortunes," "hunger-starved for innovations," "turbulent spirits," and "fit for
  all alterations," take a house within the precincts of a royal palace, and close to the
  Upper House of Parliament, dig a mine, hammer away for over two months at the wall,
  acquire and bring in four tons of gunpowder, storing it in a large and conspicuous
  chamber immediately beneath that of the Peers, and covering it with an amount of fuel
  sufficient for a royal establishment&mdash;and meanwhile those responsible for the
  government of the country have not even the faintest suspicion of any possible danger.
  "Never," it is said,<sup><a name="FN167A" id="FN167A"></a><a href=
  "#FN167">[167]</a></sup> "was treason more secret, or ruin more apparently inevitable,"
  while the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg
  77]</a></span>Secretary of State himself declared<sup><a name="FN168A" id=
  "FN168A"></a><a href="#FN168">[168]</a></sup> that such ruin was averted only by the
  direct interposition of Heaven, in a manner nothing short of miraculous.</p>

  <p>It must be remembered that the government thus credited with childlike and culpable
  simplicity, was probably the most suspicious and inquisitive that ever held power in
  this country, for its tenure whereof it trusted mainly to the elaborate efficiency of
  its intelligence department. Of a former secretary, Walsingham, Parsons wrote that he
  "spent infinite upon spyery,"<sup><a name="FN169A" id="FN169A"></a><a href=
  "#FN169">[169]</a></sup> and there can be no doubt that his successor, now in office,
  had studied his methods to good purpose. "He," according to a panegyrist,<sup><a name=
  "FN170A" id="FN170A"></a><a href="#FN170">[170]</a></sup> "was his craft's master in
  foreign intelligence and for domestic affairs," who could tell at any moment what ships
  there were in every port of Spain, their burdens, their equipment, and their
  destination. We are told<sup><a name="FN171A" id="FN171A"></a><a href=
  "#FN171">[171]</a></sup> that he could discover the most secret business transacted in
  the Papal Court before it was known to the Catholics in England. He could intercept
  letters written from Paris to Brussels, or from Rome to Naples.<sup><a name="FN172A"
  id="FN172A"></a><a href="#FN172">[172]</a></sup> What was his activity at home is
  sufficiently evidenced by the reports furnished by his numerous agents concerning
  everything done throughout the country, in particular by Recusants; whereof we shall
  see more, in connection with this particular <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78"
  id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>affair. That those so remarkably wide-awake in regard of
  all else should have been blind and deaf to what was passing at their own doors appears
  altogether incredible.</p>

  <p>More especially do difficulties connect themselves with the gunpowder itself. Of
  this, according to the lowest figure given us, there were over four tons.<sup><a name=
  "FN173A" id="FN173A"></a><a href="#FN173">[173]</a></sup> How, we may ask, could half a
  dozen men, "notorious Recusants," and bearing, moreover, such a character as we have
  heard, without attracting any notice, and no question being asked, possess themselves
  of such a quantity of so dangerous a material?<sup><a name="FN174A" id=
  "FN174A"></a><a href="#FN174">[174]</a></sup> How large was the amount may be estimated
  from the fact that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg
  79]</a></span>it was more than a quarter of what, in 1607, was delivered from the royal
  store, for all purposes, and was equal to what was thought sufficient for Dover Castle,
  while there was no more in the four fortresses of Arcliffe, Walmer, Deal, and Camber
  together.<sup><a name="FN175A" id="FN175A"></a><a href="#FN175">[175]</a></sup></p>

  <p>The twenty barrels first procured were first, as we have seen, stored beyond the
  Thames, at Lambeth, whence they had to be ferried across the river, hauled up the much
  frequented Parliament Stairs, carried down Parliament Place, as busy a quarter as any
  in the city of Westminster, and into the building adjoining the Parliament House, or
  the "cellar" beneath the same. All this, we are to suppose, without attracting
  attention or remark.<sup><a name="FN176A" id="FN176A"></a><a href=
  "#FN176">[176]</a></sup></p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

  <p>The conspirators, while making these material preparations, were likewise busy in
  settling their plan of action when the intended blow should have been struck. It was by
  no means their intention to attempt a revolution. Their quarrel was purely personal
  with King James, his Council, and his Parliament, and, these being removed, they
  desired to continue the succession in its legitimate course, and to seat on the throne
  the nearest heir who might be available for the purpose; placing the new sovereign,
  however, under such tutelage as should insure the inauguration of a right course of
  policy. The details of the scheme were of as lunatic a character as the rest of the
  business. The confederates would have wished to possess themselves of Prince Henry, the
  king's eldest son; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg
  81]</a></span>but as he would probably accompany his father to the opening of
  Parliament, and so perish, their desire was to get hold of his brother, the Duke of
  York, afterwards Charles I., then but five years old. It was, however, possible that he
  too might go to Parliament, and otherwise it might not improbably be impossible to get
  possession of him: in which case they were prepared to be satisfied with the Princess
  Elizabeth,<sup><a name="FN177A" id="FN177A"></a><a href="#FN177">[177]</a></sup> or
  even with her infant sister Mary, for whom, as being English born, a special claim
  might be urged.</p>

  <p>Such was the project in general. When we come to details, we are confronted, as
  might be anticipated, with statements impossible to reconcile. We are
  told,<sup><a name="FN178A" id="FN178A"></a><a href="#FN178">[178]</a></sup> that Percy
  undertook to seize and carry off Duke Charles; and again,<sup><a name="FN179A" id=
  "FN179A"></a><a href="#FN179">[179]</a></sup> that, despairing of being able to lay
  hands upon him, they resolved "to serve themselves with the Lady Elizabeth," and that
  Percy was one of those who made arrangements for seizing her;<sup><a name="FN180A" id=
  "FN180A"></a><a href="#FN180">[180]</a></sup> and again, that having learnt that Prince
  Henry was not to go to the House, they determined to surprise him, "and leave the young
  Duke alone;"<sup><a name="FN181A" id="FN181A"></a><a href="#FN181">[181]</a></sup> and
  once more, that they never entered into any consultation or formed any project whatever
  as to the succession.<sup><a name="FN182A" id="FN182A"></a><a href=
  "#FN182">[182]</a></sup></p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

  <p>Still more serious are the contradictions on another point. We are told, on the one
  hand, that a proclamation was drawn up for the inauguration of the new
  sovereign&mdash;whoever this was<sup><a name="FN183A" id="FN183A"></a><a href=
  "#FN183">[183]</a></sup>&mdash;and, on the other, that the associates were resolved not
  to avow the explosion to be their work until they should see how the country took it,
  or till they had gathered a sufficient force,<sup><a name="FN184A" id=
  "FN184A"></a><a href="#FN184">[184]</a></sup> and accordingly that they had no more
  than a project of a proclamation to be issued in due season. But, again, it is
  said<sup><a name="FN185A" id="FN185A"></a><a href="#FN185">[185]</a></sup> that Catesby
  on his way out of town, after the event, was to proclaim the new monarch at Charing
  Cross, though it is equally hard to understand, either how he was to know which of the
  plans had succeeded, and who that monarch was to be,&mdash;whether a king or a
  queen,&mdash;or what effect such proclamation by an obscure individual like himself was
  expected to produce; or how this, or indeed any item in the programme was compatible
  with the incognito of the actors in the great tragedy.</p>

  <p>Amid this hopeless tangle one point alone is perfectly clear. Whatever was the
  scheme, it was absolutely insane, and could by no possibility have succeeded. As Mr.
  Gardiner says:<sup><a name="FN186A" id="FN186A"></a><a href="#FN186">[186]</a></sup>
  "With the advantage of having an infant sovereign in their hands, with a little money
  and a few horses, these sanguine dreamers fancied that they would have the whole of
  England at their feet."</p>

  <p>Such is in outline the authorized version of the history concerning what Father John
  Gerard styles <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg
  84]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg
  83]</a></span>"this preposterous Plot of Powder;" and preposterous it undoubtedly
  appears to be in more senses than he intended. It is, in the first place, almost
  impossible to believe that the important and dramatic episode of the mine ever, in
  fact, occurred. We have seen something of the difficulties against accepting this part
  of the story, which the circumstantial evidence suggests. When, on the other hand, we
  ask upon what testimony it rests, it is a surprise to find that for so prominent and
  striking an incident we are wholly dependent upon two documents, published by the
  government, a confession of Thomas Winter and another of Faukes, both of which present
  features rendering them in the highest degree suspicious. Amongst the many confessions
  and declarations made by the conspirators in general, and these individuals in
  particular, these two alone describe the mining operations.<sup><a name="FN187A" id=
  "FN187A"></a><a href="#FN187">[187]</a></sup></p>

    title="" /> <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">cell in staircase turret, s.e.
    corner, painted chamber, often called "guy faukes' cell."</span></span>
  </div>

  <p>On the other hand, it is somewhat startling to find no less a person than the Earl
  of Salisbury himself ignorant or oblivious of so remarkable a circumstance. In Thomas
  Winter's lodging was found the agreement between Percy and Ferrers for the lease of the
  house, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>which was
  taken, as has been said, in May, 1604. This is still preserved, and has been endorsed
  by Cecil, "The bargaine between Percy and Ferrers for the bloody sellar...." But this
  contract had nothing to do with the "bloody sellar," which was not rented till ten
  months later. Again, writing November 9th, 1605, to Cornwallis and Edmondes, Cecil
  says: "This Percy had about a year and a half ago hired a part of Vyniard's house in
  the old Palace, from whence he had access into this vault to lay his wood and coal, and
  as it seemeth now [had] taken this place of purpose to work some mischief in a fit
  time." When this was written the premises had been for four days in the hands of the
  government. It is clearly impossible that the remains of the mine, had they existed,
  should not have been found, and equally so that Cecil should not have alluded to the
  overwhelming evidence they afforded as to the intention of Percy and his associates to
  "work some mischief," but should, again, have connected the tenancy of the house only
  with the "cellar."</p>

  <p>It will, moreover, be found by investigators that when exceptional stress is laid on
  any point by Sir E. Coke, the Attorney General, a <i>prima facie</i> case against the
  genuine nature of the evidence in regard of that point is thereby established. In his
  speech on the trial of the conspirators we find him declaring that, "If the cellar had
  not been hired, the mine work could hardly, or not at all, have been discovered, for
  the mine was neither found nor suspected until the danger was past, and the capital
  offenders apprehended, and by themselves, upon examination, confessed." That is to say,
  the government could not, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg
  86]</a></span>though provided with information that there was a powder-mine under the
  Parliament House, have discovered this extraordinary piece of engineering; and
  moreover, after its abandonment, the traces of the excavation were so artfully hidden
  as to elude observation till the prisoners drew attention to them. Such assertions
  cannot possibly be true; but they might serve to meet the objection that no one had
  seen the mine.</p>

  <p>We likewise find that in his examination of November 5th, Faukes is made to say: "He
  confesseth that about Christmas last [1604], he brought in the nighttime Gunpowder
  <i>to the cellar under the upper house of Parliament</i>," that is some three months
  before the cellar was hired. Moreover, the words italicised have been added as an
  interlineation, apparently by Cecil himself. Evidently when this was done the mine was
  still undiscovered.</p>

  <p>Yet more remarkable is the fact that it would appear to have remained undiscovered
  ever afterwards, and that no marks seem to have been left upon the wall which had been
  so roughly handled. It is certainly impossible to find any record that such traces were
  observed when the building was demolished, though they could scarcely have failed to
  attract attention and interest. On this subject we have the important evidence of Mr.
  William Capon, who carefully examined every detail connected with the old palace, and
  evidently had the opportunity of studying the foundations of the House of Lords when,
  in 1823, that building was removed.<sup><a name="FN188A" id="FN188A"></a><a href=
  "#FN188">[188]</a></sup> He does, indeed, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id=
  "Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>mention what he conceives to be the traces of the
  conspirators' work, of which he gives the following description:</p>

  <p>"Adjoining the south end of the Cellar, or more properly the ancient Kitchen, to the
  west, was a small room separated only by a stone doorway, with a pointed head, and with
  very substantial masonry joined to the older walls.... At the North side [of this]
  there had been an opening, a doorway of very solid thick stonemasonry, through which
  was a way seemingly forced through by great violence.... In 1799 it was asserted that
  this was always understood to have been the place where the conspirators broke into the
  vault which adjoined that called Guy Vaux's cellar."<sup><a name="FN189A" id=
  "FN189A"></a><a href="#FN189">[189]</a></sup></p>

  <p>But against such a supposition there are three fatal objections. (1) This places the
  conspirators on the wrong side of the house, for they most certainly worked from the
  east, or river side, not from the west.<sup><a name="FN190A" id="FN190A"></a><a href=
  "#FN190">[190]</a></sup> (2) It makes the mine above ground instead of below. (3) The
  conspirators never broke into the cellar at all, but hired it in the ordinary way of
  business.</p>

  <p>Such considerations as the above may well make us sceptical in regard to the mine,
  and if this element of the story, upon which so much stress has always been laid, prove
  to be untrustworthy, it must needs follow that grave suspicion will be cast upon the
  rest.</p>

  <p>There are, likewise, various problems in connection with the "cellar," especially as
  concerns the means of ingress to it, and its consequent privacy or publicity.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) Faukes says (November 6th, 1605) that about the middle of Lent of that
  year Percy caused "a new dore" to be made into it, "that he might have a neerer way out
  of his own house into the cellar."</p>

  <p>This seems to imply that Percy took the cellar for his firewood when there was no
  convenient communication between it and his house. Moreover it is not very easy to
  understand how a tenant under such conditions as his was allowed at discretion to knock
  doors through the walls of a royal palace. Neither did the landlady say anything of
  this door-making, when detailing what she knew about Percy's proceedings.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) In some notes by Sir E. Coke,<sup><a name="FN191A" id=
  "FN191A"></a><a href="#FN191">[191]</a></sup> it is said: "The powder was first brought
  into Percy's house, and lay there in a low room new built, and could not have been
  conveyed into the cellar by the old door but that all the street must have seen it; and
  therefore he caused a new door out of his house into the cellar to be made, where
  before there had been a grate of iron."</p>

  <p>This, it must be confessed, looks very like an afterthought to explain away a
  difficulty, but failing to do so. When the door is said to have been made, the powder
  was already on the premises, having been brought there in sight of the whole street and
  the river. It could hardly, in so small a tenement, escape the observation of the
  workmen,<sup><a name="FN192A" id="FN192A"></a><a href="#FN192">[192]</a></sup> while
  the operations of these latter in breaking through the wall <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>would have served yet
  farther to attract the attention of the neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) We are told by Faukes and others, that either he or Percy always kept the
  key, and that marks were made to indicate whether anyone had entered the place in their
  absence.</p>

  <p>(<i>d</i>) On the other hand, to say nothing of Winter's declaration that the
  confederates so arranged as to leave the cellar free for all to enter who would, Lord
  Salisbury informed Sir Thomas Parry<sup><a name="FN193A" id="FN193A"></a><a href=
  "#FN193">[193]</a></sup> that the captors of Faukes entered through "another door,"
  which clearly did not require to be opened by him; while as to the ordinary door,
  whichever this was, the "King's Book" itself plainly intimates, in the account of the
  chamberlain's visit, that Whynniard, the landlord, was able to open it when he
  chose.</p>

  <p>The "other door" spoken of by Cecil, a most important feature of the chamber, is
  nowhere else mentioned.<sup><a name="FN194A" id="FN194A"></a>[<a href=
  "#FN194">194]</a></sup></p>

  <p>It appears certain that the conspirators really had a plot in hand, that they
  fancied themselves to be about to strike a great blow, and that by means of gunpowder;
  but what was the precise nature of their plans and preparations it is not so easy to
  determine. Farther discussion of these particulars must be deferred to a later chapter.
  Meanwhile, according to the accepted history, when they had stored their powder there
  was nothing more to do but to await the assembling <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>of the intended victims. Parliament stood
  prorogued till October 3rd, and was afterwards further adjourned till the fateful 5th
  of November. That they might not excite suspicion, the confederates separated, most of
  them retiring to their country seats, and Faukes going over to Flanders.<sup><a name=
  "FN195A" id="FN195A"></a><a href="#FN195">[195]</a></sup> In his absence Percy kept the
  key of the cellar, and, according to Faukes,<sup><a name="FN196A" id=
  "FN196A"></a><a href="#FN196">[196]</a></sup> laid in more powder and wood while he
  himself was absent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg
  90]</a></span></p>

  <div class="figcenter c9">

    "800" alt="THE POWDER PLOT. II." title="" /> <span class="caption"><span class=
    "smcap">the powder plot. ii.</span></span>
  </div>

  <p>It is not easy to understand what became of the cellar during this long interval,
  and apparently it was left in great measure, with its compromising contents, to take
  care of itself, for Percy, amongst other places, went with Catesby to Bath to take the
  waters.<sup><a name="FN197A" id="FN197A"></a><a href="#FN197">[197]</a></sup> If the
  premises were of so public a nature as the testimony of Winter and others would imply,
  it appears impossible that they should have remained all this time sealed up, or that
  these astute and crafty plotters should with a light heart have ignored the probability
  that they would be visited and inspected. As Father Greenway observes,<sup><a name=
  "FN198A" id="FN198A"></a><a href="#FN198">[198]</a></sup> it can hardly be supposed
  that the landlord<sup><a name="FN199A" id="FN199A"></a><a href="#FN199">[199]</a></sup>
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>had not a
  duplicate key, while Cecil himself, in his letter to Sir Thomas Parry, plainly
  indicates that access to the cellar could freely be procured independently of the
  conspirators. We can only say that the conduct of the confederates in this particular
  appears to have been quite in keeping with their method of conspiring secretly as we
  have already seen it, and undoubtedly one more difficulty is thus opposed to the
  supposition that their enterprise was chiefly dangerous on account of the clandestine
  and dexterous manner in which it was conducted.</p>

    The name "old House of Lords" is somewhat ambiguous, being variously applicable to
    three different buildings:</p>

    <p class="ni">(i.) That here described, which continued to be used till the Irish
    Union, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1800.</p>

    <p class="ni">(ii.) The "Court of Requests," or "White Hall," used from 1800 till the
    fire of 1834.</p>

    <p class="ni">(iii.) The "Painted Chamber," which, having been repaired after the
    said fire, became the place of assembly for the Lords, as did the Court of Requests
    for the Commons.</p>

    <p>The original House of Lords was demolished in 1823 by Sir John Soane, who on its
    site erected his Royal Gallery. (See Brayley and Britton, <i>History of the Palace of
    Westminster</i>.)</p>

    <p class="ni"><sup><a name="FN130" id="FN130"></a><a href="#FN130A">[130]</a></sup>
    The authority for this is the Earl of Northampton, who at Father Garnet's trial
    mentioned that it was so stated in ancient records. Remains of a buttery hatch in the
    south wall confirmed his assertion.</p>

    <p>The foundations of the building were believed to date from the time of Edward the

    On this point we are furnished with more than the usual amount of variety as to
    details. Cecil, writing to the ambassadors (Cornwallis, Edmondes, etc.), says there
    were "two hodgsheads and some 30 small barrels." The King's <i>Discourse</i> mentions
    36 barrels. Barclay (<i>Conspiratio Anglicana</i>) says there were over 9,000 lb. of
    powder, in 32 barrels, and that one of extra size had been placed under the throne,
    for treason could not without dread assail Majesty even when unarmed. The indictment
    of the conspirators named 30 barrels and 4 hogsheads. Sir E. Coke always said 36
    barrels. Barlow's <i>Gunpowder Treason</i> makes the extraordinary statement,
    frequently reproduced, that "to the 20 Barrels of Powder laid in at first, they added
    in July 20 more, and at last made up the number Thirty-six." Faukes (November 5th)
    said that of the powder "some was put in hoggesheads, some in Barrels, and some in
    firkins." Faukes also says that the powder was conveyed to the place in hampers. John
    Chamberlain, writing to Dudley Carleton, November 7th, 1605, says it was carried in
    satchels. Barlow (<i>ut sup.</i>) quotes the amount as 9,000 or 10,000 lb.</p>

    The amount, it would seem, cannot have been less than this. A barrel of gunpowder,
    containing four firkins, weighed 400 lb., and had the casks in the cellar all been
    barrels, in the strict sense of the word, the amount would therefore have exceeded
    six tons. Some of these casks, we are told, were small, but some were hogsheads. The
    twenty barrels first laid in are described as "whole barrels." (Faukes, January 20th,

    An interesting illustration of this point is furnished by a strange piece of evidence
    furnished by W. Andrew, servant to Sir E. Digby. Sir Everard's office was to organize
    the rising in the Midlands, after the catastrophe, but he apparently forgot to supply
    himself with powder till the very eve of the appointed day. Andrew averred that on
    the night of November 4th, his master secretly asked him to procure some powder in
    the neighbouring town, whereupon he asked, "How much? A pound, or half a pound?" Sir
    Everard said 200 or 300 lb. Deponent purchased one pound. (Tanner MSS. lxxv. f. 205
    b.)</p>

    <p>One Matthew Batty mentioned Lord Monteagle as having bought gunpowder.
    (<i>Ibid.</i> v. 40.)</p>

    <p>In the same collection is a copy of some notes by Sir E. Coke (f. 185 b), in which
    the price of the powder discovered is put down as &pound;200, <i>i.e.</i> some
    &pound;2,000 of our money.</p>

    <p class="ni"><sup><a name="FN175" id="FN175"></a><a href="#FN175A">[175]</a></sup>
    Gunpowder was measured by the <i>last</i> = 2,400 lb. (Tomline's <i>Law
    Dictionary</i>.) In 1607 there were delivered out of the store 14 lasts and some
    cwts. In 1608 the amount in various strong places is entered as: "<i>Dover
    Castle</i>, 4 lasts; <i>Arcliffe Bullwark</i>, 1 last; <i>Walmer</i>, 1 last, 8 cwt.;
    <i>Deal Castle</i>, 1 last; <i>Sandown Castle</i>, 2 lasts, etc.; <i>Sandgate</i>, 1
    last; <i>Camber</i>, 1 last."</p>

    <p class="ni"><sup><a name="FN176" id="FN176"></a><a href="#FN176A">[176]</a></sup>
    The position and character of the "cellar" admit of no doubt, as appears from the
    testimony of Smith's <i>Antiquities of Westminster</i>, Brayley and Britton's
    <i>Ancient Palace of Westminster</i>, and Capon's notes on the same, <i>Vetusta
    Monumenta</i>, v. They are, however, inconsistent with some circumstances alleged by
    the government. Thus, Sir Everard Digby's complicity with "the worst part" of the
    treason, which on several occasions he denied, is held to be established by a
    confession of Faukes, which cannot now be found among the State Papers, but which is
    mentioned in Sir E. Coke's speech upon Digby's arraignment, and is printed in
    Barlow's <i>Gunpowder Treason</i>, p. 68. In Sir E. Coke's version it runs thus:
    "Fawkes, then present at the bar, had confessed, that some time before that session,
    the said Fawkes being with Digby at his house in the country, about which time there
    had fallen much wet, Digby taking Fawkes aside after supper, told him he was much
    afraid that the powder in the cellar was grown damp, and that some new must be
    provided, lest that should not take fire."</p>

    <p>Seeing, however, that the powder stood above ground, within a most substantial
    building, and could be reached by the rain only if this should first flood the
    Chamber of the Peers, it does not seem as if the idea of such a danger should have
    suggested itself.</p>

    <p>Another interesting point in connection with the "cellar" is that the House of
    Lords having subsequently been removed to the Court of Requests, and afterwards to
    the Painted Chamber, "Guy Faukes' Cellar" on each occasion accompanied the migration.
    From Leigh's <i>New Picture of London</i> we find that in 1824-5, when the Court of
    Requests was in use, and the old cellar had completely disappeared, Guy's Cellar was
    still shown; while a plate given in Knight's <i>Old England</i>, and elsewhere,
    represents a vault under the Painted Chamber, not used as the House of Lords till
    after 1832. Such a cellar seems to have been considered a necessary appurtenance of
    the House.</p>

    There is also an allusion to the same in the confession of Keyes, November 30th,

    being killed in the field. Strangely enough, though Keyes may be cited as a witness
    on this subject, on which his evidence is of such singular importance, the

    wherein he is mentioned as one of the excavators, substituting Robert Winter's name

    According to Smith's plan (<i>sup.</i> p. 59) there were four entrances to the
    cellar, none of which can have been Percy's "new dore."</p>

    We are told that Faukes was selected to take charge of the house, and perform other
    duties which would bring him into notice, because being unknown in London he was not
    likely to excite remark. In his declaration, November 8th, however, he gives as his
    reason for going abroad, "lest, being a dangerous man, he should be known and
    suspected." It is obvious that in the meantime the cellar must either have been left
    in charge of others better known, and therefore more likely to excite suspicion, or
    have been left unprotected.</p>

    This, as we have heard, was Mr. Whynniard, who unfortunately died very suddenly on
    the morning of November 5th, on hearing of the "discovery," evidence of great
    importance as to the hiring of the house and "cellar" being thus lost. "As for the
    keeper of the parliament house," says Goodman, "who let out the lodgings to Percy, it
    is said that as soon as ever he heard of the news what Percy intended, he instantly
    fell into a fright and died; so that it could not be certainly known who procured him
    the house, or by whose means."&mdash;<i>Court of King James</i>, i. 107.</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

  <h3>THE GOVERNMENT INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT.</h3>

  <p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Having</span> followed the history of the plotters
  and their doings, to the point when everything was ready for action, we have now to
  inquire what, in the meantime, those were about for whose destruction such notable
  preparations were making, and whether in truth they were, as we are assured, wrapped in
  a sense of false security, and altogether unconscious of the signs and tokens that
  should have awakened their suspicion and alarm.</p>

  <p>When, by the aid of such evidence as remains to us, we turn to examine the facts of
  the case, we discover in them, it must be confessed, no symptoms whatever of supineness
  or lethargy. It appears, on the contrary, that throughout the period when the
  government are supposed to have been living in a fool's paradise, and tranquilly
  assuming that all was well, they were in reality busily at work through their
  emissaries and informers, prying into all the doings of the recusant Catholics,
  receiving frequent intimation of all that was undertaken, or even projected, and,
  apparently, regulating the main features of a treasonable conspiracy, which can have
  been no other than the Powder Plot itself, determining, in particular, what individuals
  should be implicated therein.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

  <p>In April, 1604, at the very time when we hear of the Plot as being hatched, a letter
  was addressed to Sir Thomas Challoner, an official frequently mixed up with business of
  this kind, by one Henry Wright,<sup><a name="FN200A" id="FN200A"></a><a href=
  "#FN200">[200]</a></sup> reporting the proceedings of a subordinate agent, by name
  Davies, whom he styles a "discoverer,"<sup><a name="FN201A" id="FN201A"></a><a href=
  "#FN201">[201]</a></sup> then engaged in working a Catholic treason, with the special
  object of incriminating priests. Davies has offered to "set," or mark
  down,<sup><a name="FN202A" id="FN202A"></a><a href="#FN202">[202]</a></sup> over
  threescore of these, but Wright has told him that so many are not required, and that he
  will satisfy his employers if he implicate twenty, provided they be "most principal
  Jesuits and seminary priests," and therewithal has given him thirteen or fourteen names
  that will serve the required purpose. Davies replies, "that by God's grace he will
  absolutely do it ere long."<sup><a name="FN203A" id="FN203A"></a><a href=
  "#FN203">[203]</a></sup></p>

  <p>That the treason in question was none other than the Gunpowder Plot there can be no
  question, unless indeed we are to say that the authorities were engaged in fabricating
  a bogus conspiracy for which there was no foundation whatever in fact. It was not the
  way of statesmen of the period, when on the track of sedition, to relinquish the
  pursuit till they had sifted it to the bottom, and at this juncture, especially, every
  shred of evidence regarding Catholics and their conduct was threshed out to the
  uttermost. In consequence, we are able to say with certainty, that <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>besides the enterprise of
  Catesby and his associates, there was no other conspiracy of any kind on foot. We have,
  moreover, already seen that the very same point thus by anticipation represented as all
  important, is that which after the "discovery" every nerve was strained to establish,
  namely, the complicity of the Catholic clergy. If we had no more than this internal
  evidence, it would abundantly suffice to assure us that the conspiracy thus sedulously
  watched was the same as that miraculously "discovered" a year and a half later.</p>

  <p>But we are not left to such inferences alone. In March, 1606, we find Wright
  applying to the minister for a reward on account of his services "in discovering
  villainous practices," thus indicating that by this time those which he had been
  tracking had been brought to light. More explicit still is a memorial presented to the
  king, at a later date, on his behalf. This is entitled&mdash;"Touching Wright and his
  services performed <i>in the damnable plot of the Powder treason</i>." King James is
  reminded that Chief Justice Popham and Sir Thomas Challoner had a hand in the discovery
  of the Powder, and this by means of information supplied by Wright, "for two years
  space almost" before his Majesty interpreted the famous letter to Lord Monteagle, "like
  an angel of God." This information Popham and Challoner had from time to time
  communicated to his Majesty, "whose hand Wright hath in testimony of his services in
  the matter."<sup><a name="FN204A" id="FN204A"></a><a href="#FN204">[204]</a></sup></p>

  <p>In the same month of April, 1604, was supplied <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>another piece of information, singularly
  interesting and important,<sup><a name="FN205A" id="FN205A"></a><a href=
  "#FN205">[205]</a></sup> in which were detailed the particulars of a design amongst the
  Catholics at home and abroad. Much, in fact the bulk, of the information given, is
  seen, in the light of our present knowledge, to be purely fictitious, affording a good
  example of the "sophistications" which, as Cecil himself complained, his agents were
  wont to mingle with their intelligence. The design in question was represented as being
  of the most serious and secret nature, the papists thinking that it "must now be so
  handled and carried as the great cause may lose no reputation, or if any suspicion
  should grow in the state, or any come in question therefore, the main point might never
  come to light;" the said "main point" being of course the complicity of the Catholic
  clergy.</p>

  <p>What invests this document with singular importance is the fact that we hear of it
  again. In April, 1606, it was quoted for the benefit of Parliament by the Attorney
  General, Sir E. Coke, and explicitly as having reference to the Gunpowder Plot, forming
  part of the evidence adduced by him to secure the attainder of persons accused of being
  partakers in that treason.<sup><a name="FN206A" id="FN206A"></a><a href=
  "#FN206">[206]</a></sup> It thus affords a proof, on the authority of the government
  itself, that eighteen months before the conspiracy was "discovered," intelligence
  regarding it had been received and was being attended to.</p>

  </div>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

  <p>This is, however, by no means the only information of which we find traces. Amongst
  the Cecil papers at Hatfield is a letter dated December 20th, 1605, addressed to the
  Earl of Salisbury by one Thomas Coe, who claims to have previously forwarded to his
  Majesty "the primary intelligence of these late dangerous treasons," upon which
  communication the historian Lodge observes,<sup><a name="FN207A" id=
  "FN207A"></a><a href="#FN207">[207]</a></sup> "It should seem then that the famous
  letter transmitted to James by Lord Monteagle, for the right construction of which that
  Prince's penetration hath been so highly extolled by some historians, was not the only
  previous intelligence communicated to him of the Gunpowder Treason."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the officers of the government, in all parts, appear to have been no less
  alert than was their wont. On the 9th of January, 1604-5, for instance, Sir Thomas
  Parry writes from Paris,<sup><a name="FN208A" id="FN208A"></a><a href=
  "#FN208">[208]</a></sup> inclosing a note from an informer at Dieppe, concerning an
  English Catholic returning from Italy and Spain with letters for Fathers Garnet and
  Oldcorne, and a cipher of three lines for a lawyer at Douay, and although the messenger
  has contrived to give him the slip, he is able to send particulars concerning his
  personal appearance, and the locality in London where he is likely to be found. On the
  25th of the same month, Cecil replies to Parry<sup><a name="FN209A" id=
  "FN209A"></a><a href="#FN209">[209]</a></sup> concerning priests and their doings, and
  makes the valuable admission that their proceedings are always known to him by means of
  false brethren, though, he adds, these informers always add to their intelligence
  "sophistications" of their own, a fact which must not be lost sight of in studying the
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>reports of such
  folk. We hear particularly of informations supplied by the priests Bagshawe and Cecil,
  by Captain Turner, Charles Paget, and sundry others.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of October, 1605, we make the acquaintance of another notable
  informer. On the first of the month, William Willaston, then engaged on a commission in
  France in connection with a proposed commercial treaty, writes to Cecil from
  Paris<sup><a name="FN210A" id="FN210A"></a><a href="#FN210">[210]</a></sup> concerning
  a Catholic design attributed chiefly to priests and Jesuits, who have assurance that
  their friends in England, who are many and of good sort, intend "to kindle a fire in
  many corners of our land, and a rebellion in Ireland," and that these matters be almost
  grown to a head, "some of their fingers itching to be set to work." Willaston adds,
  "there is a particular irreconcilable desperate malice against your Honour's person,
  which is principally the cause I make bold to write unto your Lordship. You have yet
  the papists in your hands, and are masters; if you let them increase and grow so
  insolent, assuredly it will come to pass as to the King of Israel, who having
  overthrown Benhadab ..." and so on.</p>

  <p>On October 14th, Willaston again writes from Rouen<sup><a name="FN211A" id=
  "FN211A"></a><a href="#FN211">[211]</a></sup> "about some matters pretended by our
  Romish Catholics." The party, he says, "who" has given light into this business "is one
  George Southwaick, well-known to many of your Lordship's followers." This Southwaick,
  he holds to be "very honest;" he is going to England with sundry priests and others,
  and upon landing will at once communicate with the authorities and have his comrades
  arrested. "Southwaick <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg
  100]</a></span>himself," adds Willaston, "must be taken as well as the others, for he
  desireth not to be known to have given any information against the rest. If it please
  your Lordship to take order for his imprisonment apart, that conference privately may
  be had with him, until such time as shall be thought fit to deliver him, he can give
  you good directions for many matters, and may stand your honour in stead for such
  purposes."</p>

  <p>There follows a notable suggestion: "If your Lordship would be pleased to set some
  man to win the Nuncio of the Pope his secretary in Paris, you should receive very
  direct and sound instructions from him." The writer goes on to speak of an intended
  rebellion in England, and the kindling of a fire there, and dutifully concludes, "God
  grant they touch not the person of the King nor of his children."</p>

  <p>On the 27th of October, nine days before the "discovery," Southwaick himself, now in
  England, writes to Cecil,<sup><a name="FN212A" id="FN212A"></a><a href=
  "#FN212">[212]</a></sup> urging that the impending arrest of priests and others should
  be deferred, and that for better management of "the business, and for the better and
  more substantial manifestation thereof," he ventures to suggest that "more scope of
  time would make the service of more worth." Moreover, he gives warning of preparations
  for trouble in the shires, in connection with "their plot," and finally promises, "your
  Honour shall not only have knowledge of all such as are any way intercepted in the
  same, but also knowledge of the end of their whole purpose, and withal be certain of
  their meeting here in London, where I do not doubt to apprehend forty priests, with
  many great of name, at mass, in good speed of their great intent."</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

  <p>On the morning of the 5th of November itself, evidently before receiving news that
  the final blow had been struck, Southwaick writes to Levinus Munck, Cecil's private
  secretary.<sup><a name="FN213A" id="FN213A"></a><a href="#FN213">[213]</a></sup> He
  excuses himself for recent silence on the ground that he could not without prejudice to
  "the business" have communicated with his employers. "The parties," he declares, "have
  had, ever since I saw you, such obscure meetings, such mutable purposes, such uncertain
  resolutions, as hath made me ride both day and night, as well in foul weather as fair,
  omitting no opportunities, lest I should not effect what I have by the weight of my
  credit and the engagement of my duty and reputation propounded to my honourable Lord."
  He farther begs that nothing may be done that might disclose his true character to his
  intended victims, and concludes by declaring that, if he be not much mistaken, he is
  about "a singular service."</p>

  <p>If such letters proved nothing more, they would abundantly serve to discredit the
  idea that a government which conducted its operations in such a fashion could be
  hoodwinked by such clumsy contrivances as those of the cellar and the mine.</p>

  <p>Five days later,<sup><a name="FN214A" id="FN214A"></a><a href=
  "#FN214">[214]</a></sup> Southwaick again writes to Munck, inclosing a note of the
  priests who have had meetings in Paris, or have been written to in England. The
  Ambassador (in Paris) will, he says, bear witness that, although unable to
  particularize, he had given notice two months since that there was a plot brewing. He
  adds a significant hint, the like of which we have <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>already seen: "Should I chance to be
  apprehended, I will rest myself upon my honourable Lord."<sup><a name="FN215A" id=
  "FN215A"></a><a href="#FN215">[215]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Meanwhile the English ambassadors abroad were no less active and vigilant than the
  informers at home, and while clearly aware that there was some danger on foot, never
  doubted that the king's government would not be caught napping.</p>

  <p>On the 9th of October, Sir Thomas Edmondes wrote to Cecil from Brussels<sup><a name=
  "FN216A" id="FN216A"></a><a href="#FN216">[216]</a></sup> to warn him of suspicious
  symptoms in the Low Countries; and on the following day Cecil wrote to
  Edmondes<sup><a name="FN217A" id="FN217A"></a><a href="#FN217">[217]</a></sup>
  expressing apprehensions of trouble from the Jesuits abroad. On the same day, October
  10th, Sir Thomas Parry wrote from Paris to the secretary,<sup><a name="FN218A" id=
  "FN218A"></a><a href="#FN218">[218]</a></sup> of a petition which the Catholics were
  preparing against the meeting of Parliament, "and some further designs upon refusal;"
  and in another letter informed Edmondes:<sup><a name="FN219A" id="FN219A"></a><a href=
  "#FN219">[219]</a></sup> "somewhat is at present in hand amongst these desperate
  hypocrites, which I trust God shall divert, by the vigilant care of his Majesty's
  faithful servants and friends abroad, and prudence of his council at home."</p>

  <p>That such confidence was not misplaced is shown by Cecil's assurance to Sir Thomas
  Parry,<sup><a name="FN220A" id="FN220A"></a><a href="#FN220">[220]</a></sup> mentioned
  above, that the proceedings of the priests were never unknown to Government.</p>

  <p>Amongst the papers at Hatfield is a curious note, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>anonymous and undated, giving information
  of a plot involving murder and treason, which, like the letter to Monteagle, simulates
  rather too obviously the workmanship of an illiterate person, and artfully insinuates
  that the design in question is undertaken in the name of religion, and chiefly favoured
  by the priests.<sup><a name="FN221A" id="FN221A"></a><a href=
  "#FN221">[221]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Another remarkable document is preserved in the same collection. This is a letter
  written to Sir Everard Digby, June 11th, 1605, and treating of an otter hunt to be
  undertaken when the hay shall be cut. It has, however, been endorsed by Salisbury,
  "Letter written to Sir Everard Digby&mdash;Powder Treason."<sup><a name="FN222A" id=
  "FN222A"></a><a href="#FN222">[222]</a></sup> Not only is it hard to see how the terms
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>of the
  document lend themselves to such an interpretation, but the date at which it was
  written was fully three months prior to Digby's initiation in the conspiracy. The idea
  is certainly suggested that, far from being passive and indolent, the authorities were
  sedulously seeking pretexts to entangle as many as possible of those "great of name,"
  concerning whom we have already heard from one of their informers. This much, at any
  rate, seems clear. Those at the centre of this complex web of espionage, to whom were
  addressed all these informations and admonitions, cannot have been, as they protested
  somewhat overmuch, in a state of careless inactivity, depending for security only upon
  the protection of the Almighty, "who," as the secretary afterwards piously declared,
  "blessed us in our slumber [and] will not forsake us now that we are
  awake."<sup><a name="FN223A" id="FN223A"></a><a href="#FN223">[223]</a></sup></p>

  <p>The slumber would at least appear not to have been dreamless. On the one hand, the
  secretary was evidently much exercised by a threatened <i>rapprochement</i> between his
  royal master and Pope Clement VIII., who, through a Scotch Catholic gentleman, Sir
  James Lindsay, had sent a friendly message to King James, which had elicited a
  courteous and almost cordial reply.<sup><a name="FN224A" id="FN224A"></a><a href=
  "#FN224">[224]</a></sup> The significance of this Cecil <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>strenuously endeavoured, in a letter to the
  Duke of Lenox,<sup><a name="FN225A" id="FN225A"></a><a href="#FN225">[225]</a></sup> to
  explain away, and in February, 1604-5, we find him assuring the Archbishop of York with
  an earnestness somewhat suspicious,<sup><a name="FN226A" id="FN226A"></a><a href=
  "#FN226">[226]</a></sup> "I love not to procure or yield any toleration; a matter which
  I well know no creature living durst propound to our religious Sovereign." For himself,
  he thus declares: "I will be much less than I am, or rather nothing at all, before I
  shall become an instrument of such a miserable change." Nevertheless, on the 17th of
  April following, he was fain to acknowledge, in writing to Parry,<sup><a name="FN227A"
  id="FN227A"></a><a href="#FN227">[227]</a></sup> that the news of Pope Clement's death
  had much eased him in his mind.</p>

  <p>It would, however, appear that the spectre of possible toleration still haunted him,
  and that he felt it necessary to commit the king to a course of severity. In a minute
  of September 12th, 1605, addressed to the same ambassador, which has been corrected and
  amended with an amount of care sufficiently testifying to the importance of the
  subject,<sup><a name="FN228A" id="FN228A"></a><a href="#FN228">[228]</a></sup> after
  speaking of "the plots and business of the priests," and the tendency of Englishmen
  going abroad "in this time <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg
  106]</a></span>of peace" to become Catholics, he thus continues: "Only this is it
  wherein my own heart receiveth comfort, that we live under a most religious and
  understanding Prince, who sticketh not to publish, as well in his own particular, as in
  the form of his government, how contrary that religion is to his resolution, and how
  far he will be from ever gracing [it]." He goes on to declare that nothing will so
  avail to make his Majesty withdraw his countenance from any man as such "falling
  away."</p>

  <p>About the same time as this was written, we are told by a writer, almost a
  contemporary,<sup><a name="FN229A" id="FN229A"></a><a href="#FN229">[229]</a></sup>
  that a dependent of Cecil's warned a Catholic gentleman, by name Buck, of a "wicked
  design" which his master had in hand against the papists.</p>

  <p>On the 17th of October, more than a week before the first hint of danger is said to
  have been breathed, we find the minister writing to Sir Thomas Edmondes, at
  Brussels,<sup><a name="FN230A" id="FN230A"></a><a href="#FN230">[230]</a></sup> in
  terms which certainly appear to couple together the growing danger of conversions to
  Catholicism, of which we have heard above, and the remedy soon to be supplied by the
  new policy which the discovery of the Plot so effectively established. He speaks of the
  "insolencies" of the priests and Jesuits, who are doing much injury by infecting with
  their poison "every youth that cometh amongst them;" ominously adding, "which liberty
  must, for one cause or another, be retrenched."</p>

  <p>There can be no doubt that the issue of the Gunpowder Plot was eminently calculated
  to work such <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg
  107]</a></span>an effect; and even more would seem to have been anticipated from it
  than was actually realized, for the secretary, we are told, promised King James that in
  consequence of it not a single Jesuit should remain in England.</p>

  <p>In the accounts supplied to us as to the manner of the "discovery," we obtain much
  interesting information from the utterances of the government itself. In studying these
  we cannot fail to notice an evident effort to reconcile two conflicting interests. On
  the one hand, that the king and the nation should be properly impressed with a sense of
  their marvellous deliverance, it was essential to represent the catastrophe as having
  been imminent, which could not be unless the preparations for it had been altogether
  unsuspected; and it was likewise desirable to magnify the divine sagacity of the
  monarch, which had been the instrument of Providence to avert a disaster otherwise
  inevitable. On the other hand, however, it should not be made to appear that those to
  whose keeping the public safety was intrusted had shown themselves culpably negligent
  or incompetent; and it had therefore to be insinuated that, after all, they were not
  without "sufficient advertisement" of danger, and even of danger specifically connected
  with the actual conspirators, and directed against the Parliament. But, again, lest
  such information should appear suspiciously accurate, the actual plotters had to be
  merged in a larger body of their co-religionists, and their design to be represented in
  vague and general terms. At the time, no doubt, this was effective enough. Now however
  that we know, by the light of subsequent investigations, who exactly were engaged,
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>and what was
  in hand, it is possible to estimate these declarations at their true
  value.<sup><a name="FN231A" id="FN231A"></a><a href="#FN231">[231]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Except with the aid of such an explanation as this, it seems impossible to
  understand the endless inconsistencies and contradictions of the official narrative.
  This we have in four forms, all coming to us on the highest authority, but addressed to
  different audiences, and hopelessly at variance upon almost every point. One is that
  given to the world as the "King's Book,"<sup><a name="FN232A" id="FN232A"></a><a href=
  "#FN232">[232]</a></sup> containing, as Mr. Jardine tells us, the version which it was
  desired that the general public should accept. A second was furnished by Cecil himself
  to the ambassadors at Madrid and Brussels, and the Lord Deputy in Ireland,<sup><a name=
  "FN233A" id="FN233A"></a><a href="#FN233">[233]</a></sup> and a third to the ambassador
  at Paris.<sup><a name="FN234A" id="FN234A"></a><a href="#FN234">[234]</a></sup> We have
  likewise the minute of November 7th, already mentioned as perhaps intended for the
  information of the Privy Council, which, although it has seemingly served as the basis
  of the story told in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg
  109]</a></span>"King's Book," contradicts that story in various not unimportant
  particulars.</p>

  <p>We shall afterwards have to examine in some detail the divergencies of these several
  narratives: at present we are concerned only with the intimation which they afford of a
  previous knowledge of the Plot on the part of the government. In the "King's
  Book"&mdash;which was not only to be disseminated broadcast at home, but to be
  translated and spread abroad, and, moreover, to be suited to the taste of its supposed
  author&mdash;the preternatural acuteness of the monarch is extolled in terms of most
  preposterous flattery, and his secretary is represented as altogether incredulous of
  danger, and unwilling to be convinced even by his royal master's wonderful
  interpretation of the mysterious warning. Nevertheless, not only is mention
  parenthetically introduced of the minister's "customable and watchful care of the king
  and State, boiling within him," of his laying up these things in his heart, "like the
  Blessed Virgin Mary," and being unable to rest till he had followed the matter
  farther,&mdash;but it is dexterously intimated that, for all his hardness of belief, he
  was sufficiently well informed before the warning came to hand, and that "this accident
  did put him in mind of divers advertisements he had received from beyond the seas,
  wherewith he had acquainted as well the king himself, as divers of his Privy
  Councillors, concerning some business the Papists were in, both at home and abroad,
  making combination amongst them for some combination against this Parliament time,"
  their object being to approach the king with a petition for toleration, "which should
  be delivered in some such order, and so well backed, as the king should be <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>loth to refuse their
  requests; like the sturdy beggars craving alms with one open hand, but carrying a stone
  in the other, in case of refusal."</p>

  <p>As prepared for the Privy Council, the account, though substantially the same, was
  somewhat more explicit. The secretary was fully aware, so the Lords were told, "that
  some practices might be doubted," and he "had, any time these three months, acquainted
  the King, and some of his Majesty's inward Counsellors, that the priests and laymen
  abroad and at home were full of the papists of this kingdom, seeking still to lay some
  <i>plot</i> for procuring at this Parliament exercise of their religion."</p>

  <p>In his letter to the ambassadors Cecil was able to speak more plainly, for this
  document was not to meet the eye of James. Accordingly, he not only acknowledges that
  on seeing the Monteagle letter he at once divined the truth, and understood all about
  the powder, and moreover reverses the parts played by his Majesty and
  himself&mdash;making the former incredulous in spite of what he himself could urge in
  support of his opinion&mdash;but he goes on to give his previous information a far more
  definite complexion: "Not but that I had sufficient advertisement that most of these
  that now are fled [<i>i.e.</i> the conspirators]&mdash;being all notorious
  Recusants&mdash;with many others of that kind, had a practice in hand for some stir
  this Parliament." He, moreover, describes the plotters, in terms already cited, as
  "gentlemen spent in their fortunes and fit for all alterations."</p>

  <p>In view of all this it is quite impossible to believe the account given of
  themselves by those who were responsible for the public safety, and to suppose that
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>they were not
  only so neglectful of their duty, but so incredibly foolish, and so unlike themselves,
  as to permit a gross and palpable peril to approach unnoticed. If, on the other hand,
  as appears to be certain, the information with which they were supplied were copious
  and minute, erring by excess far more than by defect, if, instead of lethargy and
  carelessness, we find in their conduct, at every stage of the proceedings, evidence of
  the extremest vigilance and of constant activity, and if they held it of prime
  importance to disguise the facts, and were willing to incur the charge of having been
  asleep at their posts, rather than let it be thought that they knew what they did, it
  can scarcely be doubted that the history of the Gunpowder Plot given to the world was
  in its essential features what they wished it to be.<sup><a name="FN235A" id=
  "FN235A"></a><a href="#FN235">[235]</a></sup></p>

  <p>A practical illustration of the methods freely employed by statesmen of the period
  will serve to throw fuller light upon this portion of our inquiry. In the service of
  the government was one Thomas Phelippes,<sup><a name="FN236A" id="FN236A"></a><a href=
  "#FN236">[236]</a></sup> by trade a "decipherer," who was employed to "make English" of
  intercepted letters written in cipher. His services had been largely used in connection
  with Mary, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg
  112]</a></span>Queen of Scots, some of whose letters he thus interpreted, having it in
  his power, as Mr. Tytler remarks, to garble or falsify them at pleasure.<sup><a name=
  "FN237A" id="FN237A"></a><a href="#FN237">[237]</a></sup> Moreover, to serve the
  purposes of his masters, as he himself acknowledges,<sup><a name="FN238A" id=
  "FN238A"></a><a href="#FN238">[238]</a></sup> he had upon occasion forged one side of a
  correspondence, in order to induce the person addressed to commit himself in
  reply.<sup><a name="FN239A" id="FN239A"></a><a href="#FN239">[239]</a></sup> At the
  time of the Gunpowder Plot, however, Phelippes had himself fallen under suspicion, on
  account of a correspondence with Hugh Owen, of whom we shall hear elsewhere.
  Accordingly, an attempt was made to hoist him with his own petard, and another agent,
  named Barnes, was employed by Cecil to write a letter, as coming from Phelippes (who
  was then in England) and carry it to Owen in Flanders in order to draw him out. At
  Dover, however, Barnes was arrested, being mistaken for another man for whom a watch
  was being kept. Thereupon, his papers being seized and sent to the Earl of Northampton,
  who appears not to have been in the secret of this matter, Cecil was obliged to arrest
  Phelippes at once, as though the letter were genuine, instead of waiting, as he had
  intended, in order to worm out more.</p>

  <p>The story of this complex and crooked business is frankly told by Cecil himself in a
  letter to Edmondes, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg
  113]</a></span>English ambassador at Brussels, which, after the above abstract, will be
  sufficiently intelligible.<sup><a name="FN240A" id="FN240A"></a><a href=
  "#FN240">[240]</a></sup></p>

  <p>"As for Barnes, he is now returning again into Flanders, with many vows and promises
  to continue to do good service. As he was at Dover with my pass, carrying a letter from
  Philipps to Owen (of Barnes own handwriting, wherewith I was before acquainted), he was
  suddenly stayed by order from the Lord Warden, upon suspicion that he was one Acton, a
  traitor of the late conspiracy.... Whereupon, his papers and letters being sent to my
  Lord of Northampton, I thought fit not to defer any longer the calling of Philipps into
  question; which till then I had forborne, hoping by Barnes his means to have discovered
  some further matter than before I could do."</p>

    reject reason when he hears it urged on the other side.</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

  <h3>THE "DISCOVERY."</h3>

  <p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> the conspirators first undertook their
  enterprise, Parliament was appointed to meet on February 7th, 1604-5, but, as has been
  seen, it was subsequently prorogued till October 3rd, and then again till Tuesday,
  November 5th. On occasion of the October prorogation, the confederates employed Thomas
  Winter to attend the ceremony in order to learn from the demeanour of the assembled
  Peers whether any suspicion of their design had suggested this unexpected adjournment.
  He returned to report that no symptom could be discerned of alarm or uneasiness, and
  that the presence of the volcano underfoot was evidently unsuspected. Thus reassured,
  his associates awaited with confidence the advent of the fatal Fifth.</p>

  <p>In the interval occurred the event which forms the official link connecting the
  secret and the public history of the Plot, namely, the receipt of the letter of warning
  by Lord Monteagle. That the document is of supreme importance in our history cannot be
  denied, for the government account clearly stands or falls with the assertion that this
  was in reality the means whereby the impending catastrophe was averted. That it was so,
  the official story proclaimed from the first with a vehemence in itself suspicious, and
  the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>famous
  letter was exhibited to the world with a persistence and solicitude not easy to
  explain; being printed in the "King's Book," and in every other account of the affair;
  while transcribed copies were sent to the ambassadors at foreign courts and other
  public personages.<sup><a name="FN241A" id="FN241A"></a><a href=
  "#FN241">[241]</a></sup> Had a warning really been given, in such a case, to save the
  life of a kinsman or friend, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg
  116]</a></span>the circumstance, however fortunate, would scarcely have been wonderful,
  nor can we think that the document would thus have been multiplied for inspection. If,
  on the other hand, it had been carefully contrived for its purpose, it would not be
  unnatural for those who knew where the weak point lay, to wish the world to be
  convinced that there really had been a letter. It is, moreover, not easy to understand
  the importance attributed to Monteagle's service in connection with it. To have handed
  to the authorities such a message, evidently of an alarming nature, though he himself
  did not professedly understand it, does not appear to have entitled him to the
  extraordinary consideration which he in fact received. The Attorney General was
  specially instructed, at the trial, to extol his lordship's conduct.<sup><a name=
  "FN242A" id="FN242A"></a><a href="#FN242">[242]</a></sup> Wherever, in the confession
  of the conspirators, his name was mentioned, it was erased, or pasted over with paper,
  or the whole passage was omitted before publication of the document. All this is easy
  to understand if he were the instrument employed for a critical and delicate
  transaction, depending for success upon his discretion and reticence. On any other
  supposition it seems inexplicable.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Moreover, Monteagle's services received most substantial acknowledgment in the form
  of a grant of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg
  117]</a></span>&pound;700 a year,<sup><a name="FN243A" id="FN243A"></a><a href=
  "#FN243">[243]</a></sup> equivalent, at least, to ten times that amount in money of the
  present day.<sup><a name="FN244A" id="FN244A"></a><a href="#FN244">[244]</a></sup>
  There still exists<sup><a name="FN245A" id="FN245A"></a><a href=
  "#FN245">[245]</a></sup> the draft preamble of the grant making this award, which has
  been altered and emended with an amount of care which sufficiently testifies to the
  importance of the matter. In this it is said of the letter that by the knowledge
  thereof "we had the first <i>and only</i> means to discover that most wicked and
  barbarous plot"&mdash;the words italicised being added as an interlineation by Cecil
  himself. Nevertheless, it appears certain that this is not, and cannot be, the truth;
  indeed, historians of all shades equally discountenance the idea. Mr.
  Jardine<sup><a name="FN246A" id="FN246A"></a><a href="#FN246">[246]</a></sup> considers
  it "hardly credible that the letter was really the means by which the plot was
  discovered," and inclines to the belief<sup><a name="FN247A" id="FN247A"></a><a href=
  "#FN247">[247]</a></sup> that the whole story concerning it "was merely a device of the
  government ... to conceal the means by which their information had been derived."
  Similarly Mr. J.S. Brewer<sup><a name="FN248A" id="FN248A"></a><a href=
  "#FN248">[248]</a></sup> holds it as certain that this part, at least, of the story is
  a fiction designed to conceal the truth. Mr. Gardiner, who is less inclined than others
  to give up the received story, thinks that, to say the least of it, it is highly
  probable that Monteagle expected the letter before it came.<sup><a name="FN249A" id=
  "FN249A"></a><a href="#FN249">[249]</a></sup></p>

  <p>For a right understanding of the point it is necessary <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>to consider the character
  of the man who plays so important a part in this episode. Lord Monteagle, the eldest
  son of Lord Morley, ennobled under a title derived through his mother, was, in Mr.
  Jardine's opinion,<sup><a name="FN250A" id="FN250A"></a><a href=
  "#FN250">[250]</a></sup> "a person precisely adapted for an instrument on such an
  occasion;" and the description appears even more applicable than was intended. He had
  been implicated in all the doings of the turbulent section of the English
  Catholics<sup><a name="FN251A" id="FN251A"></a><a href="#FN251">[251]</a></sup> for
  several years, having taken part in the rising of Essex, and in the Spanish
  negotiations, whatever they were, conducted through the instrumentality of Thomas
  Winter. With Catesby, and others of the conspirators, he was on terms of the closest
  and most intimate friendship, and Tresham was his brother-in-law. A letter of his to
  Catesby is still preserved, which, in the opinion of some, affords evidence of his
  having been actually engaged in the Powder Plot itself;<sup><a name="FN252A" id=
  "FN252A"></a><a href="#FN252">[252]</a></sup> and Mr. Jardine, though dissenting from
  the view that the letter proves so much, judges it not at all impossible or improbable
  that he was in fact privy to the conspiracy. It is likewise certain that up to the last
  moment Monteagle was on familiar terms with the plotters, to whom, a few days before
  the final catastrophe, he imparted an important piece of information.<sup><a name=
  "FN253A" id="FN253A"></a><a href="#FN253">[253]</a></sup></p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

  <p>At the same time it is evident that Monteagle was in high favour at Court, as is
  sufficiently evidenced by the fact that he was appointed to be one of the commissioners
  for the prorogation of October 3rd, a most unusual distinction for one in his position,
  as also by the pains taken by the government on behalf of his brother, who had shortly
  before got himself into trouble in France.<sup><a name="FN254A" id=
  "FN254A"></a><a href="#FN254">[254]</a></sup> A still more remarkable circumstance has
  been strangely overlooked by historians.<sup><a name="FN255A" id="FN255A"></a><a href=
  "#FN255">[255]</a></sup> Monteagle always passed for a Catholic, turbulent indeed and
  prone to violence, but attached, even fanatically, to his creed, like his friend
  Catesby and the rest. There remains, however, an undated letter of his to the
  king,<sup><a name="FN256A" id="FN256A"></a><a href="#FN256">[256]</a></sup> in which he
  expresses his determination to become a Protestant; and while in fulsome language
  extolling his Majesty's zeal for his spiritual welfare, speaks with bitterness and
  contempt of the faith which, nevertheless, he continued to profess to the end of his
  life, and that without exciting suspicion of his deceit among the Catholics. Not only
  must this shake our confidence <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id=
  "Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>in the genuine nature of any transaction in which such a
  man played a prominent part, it must likewise suggest a doubt whether others may not in
  like manner have passed themselves off for what they were not, without arousing
  suspicion.</p>

  <p>The precise facts as to the actual receipt of the famous letter are involved, like
  every other particular of this history, in the obscurity begotten of contradictory
  evidence. In the published account,<sup><a name="FN257A" id="FN257A"></a><a href=
  "#FN257">[257]</a></sup> it is stated with great precision that it was received by
  Monteagle on Saturday, October 26th, being but ten days before the Parliament. In his
  letter to the ambassadors abroad,<sup><a name="FN258A" id="FN258A"></a><a href=
  "#FN258">[258]</a></sup> Cecil dates its receipt "about eight days before the
  Parliament should have begun." In the account furnished for the benefit of the King of
  France,<sup><a name="FN259A" id="FN259A"></a><a href="#FN259">[259]</a></sup> the same
  authority declares that it came to hand "some four or five days before." A doubt is
  thus unquestionably suggested as to whether the circumstances of its coming to
  Monteagle's hands are those traditionally described: for our present purpose, however,
  it will perhaps be sufficient to follow the story as formally told by authority in the
  king's own book.</p>

  <p>On Saturday, October 26th, ten days before the assembly of Parliament, Monteagle
  suddenly, and without previous notice, ordered a supper to be prepared <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>at his house at Hoxton
  "where he had not supped or lain of a twelvemonth and more before that
  time."<sup><a name="FN260A" id="FN260A"></a><a href="#FN260">[260]</a></sup> While he
  was at table one of his pages brought him a letter which had been given to him by a man
  in the street, whose features he could not distinguish, with injunctions to place it in
  his master's own hands. It is undoubtedly a singular circumstance, which did not escape
  notice at the time, that the bearer of this missive should have thus been able to find
  Monteagle at a spot which he was not accustomed to frequent, and the obvious inference
  was drawn, that the arrival of the letter was expected. On this point, indeed, there is
  somewhat more than inference to go upon, for in Fulman's MS. collection at Corpus
  Christi College, Oxford, among some interesting notes concerning the Plot, of which we
  shall see more, occurs the statement that "the Lord Monteagle knew there was a letter
  to be sent to him before it came."<sup><a name="FN261A" id="FN261A"></a><a href=
  "#FN261">[261]</a></sup></p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

  <p>Monteagle opened the letter, and, glancing at it, perceived that it bore neither
  date nor signature, whereupon he handed it to a gentleman of his household, named Ward,
  to read aloud, an apparently unnatural and imprudent proceeding not easy to explain,
  but, at least, inconsistent with the conduct of one receiving an obviously important
  communication in such mysterious circumstances. The famous epistle must be given in its
  native form.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Monteagle, though he saw little or nothing in this strange effusion, resolved at
  once to communicate with the king's ministers, his Majesty being at the time engaged at
  Royston in his favourite pastime of the chase, and accordingly proceeding at once to
  town, he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg
  123]</a></span>placed the mysterious document in the hands of the Earl of
  Salisbury.<sup><a name="FN262A" id="FN262A"></a><a href="#FN262">[262]</a></sup></p>

  <p>As to what thereafter followed and the manner in which from this clue the discovery
  was actually accomplished, it is impossible to say more than this, that the accounts
  handed down cannot by any possibility be true, inasmuch as on every single point they
  are utterly and hopelessly at variance. We can do no more than set down the particulars
  as supplied to us on the very highest authority.</p>

  <p class="center">A.&mdash;<i>The account published in the "King's Book."</i></p>

  <p>1. The letter was received ten days before the meeting of Parliament, <i>i.e.</i>,
  on October 26th.</p>

  <p>2. The Earl of Salisbury judged it to be the effusion of a lunatic, but thought it
  well, nevertheless, to communicate it to the king.</p>

  <p>3. This was done five days afterwards, November 1st, when, in spite of his
  minister's incredulity, James insisted that the letter could intend nothing but the
  blowing up of the Parliament with gunpowder, and that a search must be made, which,
  however, should be postponed till the last moment.</p>

  <p>4. Accordingly, on the afternoon of Monday, November <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>4th, the Lord Chamberlain going on a tour
  of inspection, visited the "cellar" and found there "great store of billets, faggots,
  and coals," and moreover, "casting his eye aside, perceived a fellow standing in a
  corner ... Guido Fawkes the owner of that hand which should have acted that monstrous
  tragedy." Coming back, the chamberlain reported that the provision of fuel appeared
  extraordinary, and that as to the man, "he looked like a very tall and desperate
  fellow."</p>

  <p>5. Thereupon the king insisted that a thorough scrutiny must be made, and that
  "those billets and coals should be searched to the bottom, it being most suspicious
  that they were laid there only for covering of the powder." For this purpose Sir Thomas
  Knyvet, a magistrate, was despatched with a suitable retinue.</p>

  <p>6. Before his entrance to the house, Knyvet found Faukes "standing without the
  doors, his boots and clothes on," and straightway apprehended him. Then, going into the
  cellar, he removed the firewood and at once discovered the barrels.</p>

  <p class="center">B.&mdash;<i>The Account sent by Salisbury to the Ambassadors abroad,
  and the Deputy in Ireland, November 9th, 1605.</i></p>

  <p>1. The letter was received about <i>eight</i> days before the Parliament.</p>

  <p>2. Upon perusal thereof, Salisbury and Suffolk, the chamberlain, "both conceived
  that it could not be more proper than the time of Parliament, nor by any other way to
  be attempted than with powder, while the King was sitting in that Assembly." With this
  interpretation <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg
  125]</a></span>other Lords of the Council agreed; but they thought it well not to
  impart the matter to the king till three or four days before the session.</p>

  <p>3. His Majesty was "hard of belief" that any such thing was intended, but his
  advisers overruled him and insisted on a search, not however till the last moment.</p>

    "smcap">arrest of guy faukes.</span></span>
  </div>

  <p>4. About 3 o'clock on the afternoon of Monday, November 4th, the Lord Chamberlain,
  Suffolk, visited the cellar, and found in it only firewood and not Faukes.</p>

  <p>5. The lords however insisting, in spite of the king, that the matter should be
  probed to the bottom, Knyvet was despatched with orders to "<i>remove all the wood, and
  so to see the plain ground underneath</i>."</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

  <p>6. Knyvet, about midnight, "going unlooked for into the vault, found that fellow
  Johnson [<i>i.e.</i>, Faukes] <i>newly come out of the vault</i>," and seized him.
  Then, having removed the wood, he perceived the barrels.</p>

  <p class="center">C.&mdash;<i>The Account furnished by Salisbury for the information of
  the King of France, November 6th, 1605. (Original draft, in the P.R.O.)</i></p>

  <p>1. The letter was received <i>some four or five days</i> before the Parliament.</p>

  <p>2. This being shown to the king and the lords, "their lordships found not good ...
  to give much credit to it, nor yet so to contemn it as to do nothing at all."</p>

  <p>3. It was accordingly determined, the night before, "to make search about that place
  and to appoint a watch in the old Palace, to observe what persons might resort
  thereabouts."</p>

  <p>4. Sir T. Knyvet, being appointed to the charge thereof, <i>going by chance, about
  midnight, into the vault, by another door, found Faukes within</i>. Thereupon he caused
  some few faggots to be removed, and so discovered some of the barrels, "<i>merely, as
  it were, by God's direction, having no other cause but a general
  jealousy</i>."<sup><a name="FN263A" id="FN263A"></a><a href=
  "#FN263">[263]</a></sup></p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

  <p>Never, assuredly, was a true story so hard to tell. Contradictions like these, upon
  every single point of the narrative, are just such as are wont to betray the author of
  a fiction when compelled to be circumstantial.</p>

  <p>To say nothing of the curious discrepancies as to the date of the warning, it is
  clearly impossible to determine the locality of Guy's arrest. The account officially
  published in the "King's Book" says that this took place in the street. The letter to
  the ambassadors assigns it to the cellar and afterwards to the street; that to Parry,
  to the cellar only. Faukes himself, in his confession of November 5th, says that he was
  apprehended neither in the street nor in the cellar, but in his own room in the
  adjoining house. Chamberlain writes to Carleton, November 7th, that it was in the
  cellar. Howes, in his continuation of Stowe's <i>Annals</i>, describes two arrests of
  Faukes, one in the street, the other upstairs in his own chamber. This point, though
  seemingly somewhat trivial, has been invested with much importance. According to the
  time-honoured story, the baffled desperado roundly declared that had he been within
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>reach of the
  powder when his captors appeared, he would have applied a match and involved them in
  his own destruction. This circumstance is strongly insisted on not only in the "King's
  Book," but also in his Majesty's speech to Parliament on November 9th, which declared,
  "and in that also was there a wonderful providence of God, that when the party himself
  was taken he was but new come out of his house from working, having his fire-work for
  kindling ready in his pocket, wherewith, as he confesseth, if he been taken immediately
  before, he was resolved to have blown up himself with his takers." We learn, however,
  from Cecil's earliest version of the history, that Faukes was apprehended in the very
  situation most suitable for such a purpose, "in the place itself, as he was busy to
  prepare his things for execution," while Chamberlain adds that he was actually engaged
  in "making his trains."</p>

  <p>Far more serious, to say nothing of the episode of the chamberlain's visit, are the
  divergencies of the several versions as to the very substance of the story. We are told
  that King James was the first to understand and interpret the letter which had baffled
  the sagacity of his Privy Council; that the Lords of the Council had fully interpreted
  it several days before the king saw it; that the said lords would not credit the king's
  interpretation; that the king would not believe their interpretation; and that neither
  the one nor the other ever interpreted it at all; that his Majesty insisted on a search
  being made in spite of the reluctance of his ministers; that they insisted on the
  search in spite of the reluctance of their royal master; and that no such search was
  ever proposed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg
  129]</a></span>by either; that Knyvet was despatched expressly to look for gunpowder,
  with instructions to rummage the firewood to the bottom, leaving no cover in which a
  barrel might lie hid; and that having no instructions to do anything of the kind, nor
  any reason to suspect the existence of any barrels, he discovered them only by a piece
  of luck, so purely fortuitous as to be clearly providential. On this last point
  especially the contradictions are absolutely irreconcilable.</p>

  <p>It is abundantly evident that those who with elaborate care produced these various
  versions were not supremely solicitous about the truth of the matter, and varied the
  tale according to the requirements of circumstances. As Mr. Jardine
  acknowledges,<sup><a name="FN264A" id="FN264A"></a><a href="#FN264">[264]</a></sup> the
  great object of the official accounts was to obtain credence for what the government
  wished to be believed, or, as Father Gerard puts it,<sup><a name="FN265A" id=
  "FN265A"></a><a href="#FN265">[265]</a></sup> these accounts were composed "with desire
  that men should all conceive this to be the manner how the treason came to light." If
  from time to time the details were altogether transformed, it was clearly not through
  any abstract love of historical accuracy, but rather that there were difficulties to
  meet and doubts to satisfy, which had to be dealt with in order to produce the desired
  effect.</p>

  <p>That, from the beginning, there was whispered disbelief, which it was held
  all-important to silence, is sufficiently attested by Cecil himself, when, on the very
  morrow of the discovery, he sent to Parry his first draft of the history. "Thus much,"
  he wrote, "I have thought necessary to impart unto you in haste, to the end that you
  may deliver as much to the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg
  130]</a></span>French king, for prevention of false bruits, which I know, as the nature
  of fame is, will be <i>increased</i>,<sup><a name="FN266A" id="FN266A"></a><a href=
  "#FN266">[266]</a></sup> perverted, and disguised according to the disposition of
  men."</p>

  <p>It does not appear why the appearance of erroneous versions of so striking an event
  should have been thus confidently anticipated if the facts were undeniably established;
  while, on the other hand, it is not a little remarkable that the narrative thus
  expressly designed to establish the truth, should have been forthwith abandoned and
  contradicted by its author in every single particular.</p>

  <p>Important information upon the same point is furnished by Cecil in another letter,
  written in the following January.<sup><a name="FN267A" id="FN267A"></a><a href=
  "#FN267">[267]</a></sup> He undertakes to explain to his correspondent how it came to
  pass that a circumstance of supreme importance, of which the government were fully
  cognizant,<sup><a name="FN268A" id="FN268A"></a><a href="#FN268">[268]</a></sup> was
  not mentioned in the official account. This he does as follows: "And although in his
  Majesty's book there is not any mention made of them [the Jesuits], and of many
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>things else
  which came to the knowledge of the State, yet is it but a frivolous inference that
  thereby [they] seek to serve their turn, considering the purpose of his Majesty was not
  to deliver unto the world all that was confessed concerning this action, <i>but so much
  only of the manner and form of it, and the means of the discovery</i>, as might make it
  apparent, both how wickedly it was conceived by those devilish instruments, and <i>how
  graciously it pleased God to deal with us in such an extraordinary discovery
  thereof</i>."</p>

  <p>Turning to the details of the story which survive the struggle for existence in the
  conflict of testimony, if any can be said to do so, there is abundant matter deserving
  attention, albeit we may at once dismiss the time-honoured legend concerning the
  sagacity of the British Solomon, and his marvellous interpretation of the riddling
  phrases which baffled the perspicacity of all besides himself.<sup><a name="FN269A" id=
  "FN269A"></a><a href="#FN269">[269]</a></sup></p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

  <p>More important is Cecil's admission that the presence of the powder under the
  Parliament House was at least suspected for several days before anything was done to
  interfere with the proceedings of those who had put it there. The reasons alleged for
  so extraordinary a course are manifestly absurd. It was resolved, he told the
  ambassadors, "that, till the night before, nothing should be done to interrupt any
  purpose of theirs that had any such devilish practice, but rather to suffer them to go
  on to the end of their day." In like manner he informed the Privy Council<sup><a name=
  "FN270A" id="FN270A"></a><a href="#FN270">[270]</a></sup> that it was determined to
  make no earlier search, that "such <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id=
  "Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>as had such practice in hand might not be scared before
  they had let the matter run on to a full ripeness for discovery." It certainly appears
  that, at least, it would have been well before the eleventh hour to institute
  observations as to who might be coming and going about the cellar. On the other hand,
  can it be imagined that any minister in his right senses would have allowed the
  existence of a danger so appalling to continue so long, and have suffered a desperado
  like Faukes to have gone on knocking about with his flint and steel and lantern in a
  powder magazine beneath the House of Parliament? Accidents are proverbially always
  possible, and in the circumstances described to us there would have been much more than
  a mere possibility, for the action said to have been taken by the authorities, in
  sending the chamberlain to "peruse" the vault, seems to have been expressly intended to
  give the alarm; and had the conspirators been scared it would evidently have been their
  safest plan to have precipitated the catastrophe, that in the confusion it would cause
  they might escape. How terrible such a catastrophe would have been is indicated by
  Father Greenway:<sup><a name="FN271A" id="FN271A"></a><a href="#FN271">[271]</a></sup>
  "Over and above the grievous loss involved in the destruction of these ancient and
  noble buildings, of the archives and national records, the king himself might have been
  in peril, and other royal edifices, though situate at a distance, and undoubtedly many
  would have perished who had come up to attend the Parliament." Moreover, the loss of
  life in so thickly populated a spot must have been frightful, and especially amongst
  the official classes.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

  <p>Father Greenway expresses his utter disbelief in the incident of the chamberlain's
  visit:<sup><a name="FN272A" id="FN272A"></a><a href="#FN272">[272]</a></sup> "To speak
  my own mind," he writes, "I do not see in this portion of the story any sort of
  probability." He adds another remark of great importance. If the Lord
  Chamberlain,&mdash;and, we may add, Sir T. Knyvet,&mdash;could get into the cellar
  without the assistance of Faukes, to say nothing of the "other door" which makes its
  appearance in Cecil's first version, there is an end of the secret and hidden nature of
  the place, and some one else must have had a key. How, then, about the months during
  which the powder had been lying in it; during much of which time it had been,
  apparently, left to take care of itself? Did no man ever enter and inspect it
  before?</p>

  <p>But questions far more fundamental inevitably suggest themselves. If, during ten, or
  even during five days, a minister so astute and vigilant was willing to risk the danger
  of an explosion, it certainly does not appear that he was much afraid of the powder, or
  thought there was any harm in it. We have already remarked on the strangeness of the
  circumstance that the plotters were able so easily to procure it. It may be observed
  that they appear themselves to have <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id=
  "Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>been disappointed with its quality, for we are
  told<sup><a name="FN273A" id="FN273A"></a><a href="#FN273">[273]</a></sup> that late in
  the summer they added to their store "as suspecting the former to be dank." Still more
  remarkable, however, was the conduct of the government. Immediately upon the
  "discovery" they instituted the most minute and searching inquiries as to every other
  particular connected with the conspirators. We find copious evidence taken about their
  haunts, their lodgings, and their associates: of the boatmen who conveyed them hither
  and thither, the porters who carried billets, and the carpenters who worked for them:
  inquiries were diligently instituted as to where were purchased the iron bars laid on
  top of the barrels, which appear to have been considered especially dangerous; we hear
  of sword-hilts engraved for some of the company, of three beaver hats bought by
  another, and of the sixpence given to the boy who brought them home. But concerning the
  gunpowder no question appears ever to have been asked, whence it came, or who furnished
  it. Yet this would appear to be a point at least as important as the rest, and if it
  was left in absolute obscurity, the inference is undoubtedly suggested that it was not
  wished to have questions raised. It may be added that no mention is discoverable of the
  augmentation of the royal stores by so notable a contribution as this would have
  furnished.</p>

  <p>Neither can it escape observation that whereas the powder was discovered only on the
  morning<sup><a name="FN274A" id="FN274A"></a><a href="#FN274">[274]</a></sup> of
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>November 5th,
  the peers met as usual in their chamber that very day.<sup><a name="FN275A" id=
  "FN275A"></a><a href="#FN275">[275]</a></sup> It cannot be supposed either that four
  tons of powder could have been so soon removed, or that the most valuable persons in
  the State would have been suffered to expose themselves to the risk of assembling in so
  perilous a situation.<sup><a name="FN276A" id="FN276A"></a><a href=
  "#FN276">[276]</a></sup></p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

  <p>However this may be, from the moment of the "discovery" the discovered gunpowder
  disappears from history.<sup><a name="FN277A" id="FN277A"></a><a href=
  "#FN277">[277]</a></sup></p>

    <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">discovery of gunpowder plot, and coins of
    James i.</span></span>
  </div>

  <p>There is another point which must be noticed. It might naturally be supposed that
  after so narrow an escape, and in accordance with their loud protestations of alarm at
  the proximity of a shocking calamity from which they had been so providentially
  delivered, the official authorities would have carefully guarded against the
  possibility of the like happening again. Their acts, however, were quite inconsistent
  with their words, for they did nothing of the kind. For more than seventy years
  afterwards the famous "cellar" continued to be leased in the same easy-going fashion to
  any who chose to hire it, and continued to be the receptacle of <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>all manner of rubbish and
  lumber, eminently suited to mask another battery. Not till the days of the mendacious
  Titus Oates, and under the influence of the panic he had engendered, did the Peers
  bethink themselves that a project such as that of Guy Faukes might really be a danger,
  and command that the "cellar" should be searched.<sup><a name="FN278A" id=
  "FN278A"></a><a href="#FN278">[278]</a></sup> This was done, in November, 1678, by no
  less personages than Sir Christopher Wren and Sir Jonas Moore, who reported that the
  vaults and cellars under and near the House of Lords were in such a condition that
  there could be no assurance of safety. It was accordingly ordered that they should be
  cleared of all timber, firewood, coals, and other materials, and that passages should
  be made through them all, to the end that they might easily be examined. At this time,
  and not before, was instituted the traditional searching of the cellars on the eve of
  Parliament.<sup><a name="FN279A" id="FN279A"></a><a href="#FN279">[279]</a></sup></p>

  <p>What then, it will be asked, really did occur? What was done by the conspirators?
  and what by those who discovered them?</p>

  <p>Truth to tell, it is difficult, or rather impossible, to answer such questions. That
  there was a plot of some kind cannot, of course, be doubted; that it was of such a
  nature as we have been accustomed to believe, can be affirmed only if we are willing to
  ignore difficulties which are by no means slight. There is, doubtless, a mass of
  evidence in support of the traditional story upon these points, but while its value has
  yet to be discussed, there are other considerations, hitherto overlooked, which are in
  conflict with it.</p>

  <p>Something has been said of the amazing contradictions <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>which a very slight examination of the
  official story reveals at every turn, and much more might be added under the same
  head.<sup><a name="FN280A" id="FN280A"></a><a href="#FN280">[280]</a></sup></p>

  </div>

  <p>On the other hand it is clear that even as to the material facts there was not at
  the time that unanimity which might have been expected. We have seen how anxious was
  the Secretary of State that the French court should at once be rightly informed as to
  all particulars. We learn, however, from Mr. Dudley <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>Carleton, then attached to the embassy at
  Paris,<sup><a name="FN281A" id="FN281A"></a><a href="#FN281">[281]</a></sup> that in
  spite of Cecil's promptitude he was anticipated by a version of the affair sent over
  from the French embassy in London, giving an utterly different complexion to it.
  According to this, the design had been, "That the council being set, and some lords
  besides in the chamber, a barrel of gunpowder should be fired underneath them, and the
  greater part, if not all, blown up." According to this informant, therefore, it was not
  the Parliament House but the Council Chamber which was to have been assailed, there is
  no mention of the king, and we have one barrel of powder instead of thirty-six. It is
  not easy to understand how in such a matter a mistake like this could have been made,
  for it is the inevitable tendency of men to begin by exaggerating, and not by
  minimizing, a sudden and startling peril.<sup><a name="FN282A" id="FN282A"></a><a href=
  "#FN282">[282]</a></sup></p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

  <p>Moreover, even this modest version of the affair was not suffered to pass
  unchallenged. Three days later Carleton again wrote:<sup><a name="FN283A" id=
  "FN283A"></a><a href="#FN283">[283]</a></sup> "The fire which was said to have burnt
  our king and council, and hath been so hot these two days past in every man's mouth,
  proves but <i>ignis fatuus</i>, or a flash of some foolish fellow's brain to abuse the
  world; for it is now as confidently reported there was no such matter, nor anything
  near it more than a barrel of powder found near the court."</p>

  <p>It must here be observed that the scepticism thus early manifested appears never to
  have been exorcised from the minds of French writers, many of whom, of all shades of
  thought, continue, down to our day, to assume that the real plotters were the king's
  government.<sup><a name="FN284A" id="FN284A"></a><a href="#FN284">[284]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Neither can we overlook sundry difficulties, again suggested by the facts of the
  case, which make it hard to understand how the plans of the plotters can in reality
  have been as they are represented.</p>

  <p>We have already observed on the nature of the house occupied in Percy's name. If
  this were, as Speed tells us, and as there is no reason to doubt, at <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>the service of the Peers
  during a session, for a withdrawing-room, and if the session was to begin on November
  5th, how could Faukes hope not only to remain in possession, but to carry on his
  strange proceedings unobserved, amid the crowd of lacqueys and officials with whom the
  opening of Parliament by the Sovereign must needs have flooded the premises? How was
  he, unobserved, to get into the fatal "cellar"?</p>

  <p>This difficulty is emphasized by another. We learn, on the unimpeachable testimony
  of Mrs. Whynniard, the landlady, that Faukes not only paid the last instalment of rent
  on Sunday, November 3rd, but on the following day, the day immediately preceding the
  intended explosion, had carpenters and other workfolk in the house "for mending and
  repairing thereof."<sup><a name="FN285A" id="FN285A"></a><a href=
  "#FN285">[285]</a></sup> To say nothing of the wonderful honesty of paying rent under
  the circumstances, what was the sense of putting a house in repair upon Monday, which
  on Tuesday was to be blown to atoms? And how could the practised eyes of such workmen
  fail to detect some trace of the extraordinary and unskilled operations of which the
  house is said to have been the theatre? If, indeed, the truth is that on the Tuesday
  the premises were to be handed over for official use, it is easy to understand why it
  was thought necessary to set them in order, but on no other supposition does this
  appear comprehensible.</p>

  <p>Problems, not easy to solve, connect themselves, likewise, with the actual execution
  of the conspirators' plan. If it would have been hard for Guy Faukes to get into the
  "cellar," how was he ever to get out of it <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id=
  "Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>again? We are so accustomed to the idea of darkness and
  obscurity in connection with him and his business, as perhaps to forget that his
  project was to have been executed in the very middle of the day, about noon or shortly
  afterwards. The king was to come in state with retinue and guards, and attended by a
  large concourse of spectators, who, as is usual on such occasions, would throng every
  nook and corner whence could be obtained a glimpse of the building in which the royal
  speech was being delivered.<sup><a name="FN286A" id="FN286A"></a><a href=
  "#FN286">[286]</a></sup> It cannot be doubted, in particular, that the open spaces
  adjacent to the House itself would be strictly guarded, and the populace not suffered
  to approach too near the sacred precincts, more especially when, as we have seen, so
  many suspicions were abroad of danger to his sacred Majesty, and to the Parliament.</p>

  <p>On a sudden a door immediately beneath the spot where the flower of the nation were
  assembled, would be unlocked and opened, and there would issue there-from a man,
  "looking like a very tall and desperate fellow," booted and spurred and equipped for
  travel. He was to have but a quarter of an hour to save himself from the ruin he had
  prepared.<sup><a name="FN287A" id="FN287A"></a><a href="#FN287">[287]</a></sup> What
  possible chance was there that he would have been allowed to pass?</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

  <p>As to his further plans, we have the most extravagant and contradictory accounts,
  some obviously fabulous.<sup><a name="FN288A" id="FN288A"></a><a href=
  "#FN288">[288]</a></sup> According to the least incredible, a vessel was lying below
  London Bridge ready at once to proceed to sea and carry him to Flanders; while a boat,
  awaiting him at the Parliament stairs, was to convey him to the ship.<sup><a name=
  "FN289A" id="FN289A"></a><a href="#FN289">[289]</a></sup> If this were so, it is not
  clear why he equipped himself with his spurs, which, however, are authenticated by as
  good evidence as any other feature of the story. It would also appear that, here again,
  the plan proposed was altogether impracticable, for at the time of his projected flight
  the tide would have been flowing,<sup><a name="FN290A" id="FN290A"></a><a href=
  "#FN290">[290]</a></sup> and it is well known that to attempt to pass Old London Bridge
  against it would have been like trying to row up a waterfall. Neither does it seem
  probable that the vessel would have been able to get out of the Thames for several
  hours, before which time all egress would doubtless have been stopped.</p>

  <p>Such considerations must at least avail to make us pause before we can
  unhesitatingly accept the traditional <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id=
  "Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>history, even in those broad outlines which appear to be
  best established. The main point is, however, independent of their truth. Though all be
  as has been affirmed concerning the "cellar" and its contents, and the plan of
  operations agreed upon by the traitors, the question remains as to the real nature of
  the "discovery." We have seen, on the one hand, that the official narrative bristles
  with contradictions, and, whatever be the truth, with falsehoods. On the other hand,
  the said narrative was avowedly prepared with the object of obtaining credence for the
  picturesque but unveracious assertion that the plotters' design was detected "very
  miraculously, even some twelve hours before the matter should have been put in
  execution." On the Earl of Salisbury's own admission, it had been divined almost as
  many days previously, and it was laid open at the last moment only because he
  deliberately chose to wait till the last moment before doing anything. No doubt a
  dramatic feature was thus added to the business, and one eminently calculated to
  impress the public mind: but they who insist so loudly on the miraculousness of an
  event which they alone have invested with the character of a miracle, must be content
  to have it believed that they knew still more than in an unguarded moment they
  acknowledged, and arranged other things concerning the Plot than its ultimate
  disclosure.<sup><a name="FN291A" id="FN291A"></a><a href="#FN291">[291]</a></sup></p>

    In the account forwarded to the ambassadors, there is a curious contradiction. In the
    general sketch of the discovery with which it opens, it is said that Faukes was
    captured "in the place itself," with his lantern, "making his preparations."
    Afterwards, in the detailed narrative of the proceedings, that he was taken outside.
    The fact is, that the first portion of this letter is taken bodily from that of
    November 6th to Parry, wherein the arrest of Faukes in the vault was a principal
    point. Between the 6th and the 9th this part of the story had been altered, but it
    does not seem to have been noticed that a remnant of the earlier version still
    existed in the introductory portion.</p>

    <p>It will be remarked that the account of November 6th makes no mention of the visit
    of the chamberlain to the vault, nor that of November 9th to the presence of Faukes
    at the time of this visit. The minute of November 7th says that Faukes admitted the
    chamberlain to the vault.</p>

    with the Plot," but as having been "principall comforters, to instruct the
    consciences of some of these wicked Traytors, in the lawfulnesse of the Act and
    meritoriousnesse of the same."</p>

    <p>On this it is enough to remark that when Father Garnet, the chief of the said
    Jesuits, came afterwards to be tried, no attempt whatever was made to prove any such
    thing. Cecil therefore wrote thus, and made so grave an assertion, without having any
    evidence in his hands to justify it.</p>

    <p class="ni"><sup><a name="FN269" id="FN269"></a><a href="#FN269A">[269]</a></sup>
    That King James alone solved the enigma was put forth as an article of faith. In the
    preamble to the Act for the solemnization of the 5th of November, Parliament declared
    that the treason "would have turned to utter ruin of this whole kingdom, had it not
    pleased Almighty God, by inspiring the king's most excellent Majesty with a divine
    Spirit, to discover some dark phrases of a letter...." In like manner, the monarch
    himself, in his speech to the Houses, of November 9th, informed them: "I did upon the
    instant interpret and apprehend some dark phrases therein, contrary to the ordinary
    grammar construction of them, and in another sort, than I am sure any divine or
    lawyer in any university would have taken them."</p>

    <p>This "dark phrase" was the sentence&mdash;"For the danger is past as soon as you
    have burnt the letter," which the royal sage interpreted to mean "as quickly," and
    that by these words "should be closely understood the suddenty and quickness of the
    danger, which should be as quickly performed and at an end as that paper should be of
    blazing up in the fire."</p>

    <p>Of this famous interpretation Mr. Gardiner says that it is "certainly absurd;"
    while Mr. Jardine is of opinion that the words in question "must appear to every
    common understanding mere nonsense."</p>

    <p>When it was proposed in the House of Commons (January 31st, 1605-6,) to pass a
    vote of thanks to Lord Monteagle for his share in the "discovery," one Mr. Fuller
    objected that this would be to detract from the honour of his Majesty, for "the true
    discoverer was the king."</p>

    <p>The reader will perhaps be reminded of Sir Walter Scott's inimitable picture of
    the king's satisfaction in this notable achievement.</p>

    <p>"Do I not ken the smell of pouther, think ye? Who else nosed out the Fifth of

    F. 66. It will be remembered that this episode is not mentioned by Cecil in his
    version of November 6th. Bishop Goodman's opinion is that this and other points of
    the story were contrived for stage effect: "The King must have the honour to
    interpret that it was by gunpowder; and the very night before the parliament began it
    was to be discovered, to make the matter the more odious, and the deliverance the
    more miraculous. No less than the lord chamberlain must search for it and discover
    it, and Faux with his dark lantern must be apprehended." (<i>Court of King James</i>,

    The list of those present is given in the <i>Lords' Journals</i>; it is headed by the
    Lord Chancellor (Ellesmere), and includes the Archbishop of Canterbury, fourteen
    bishops, and thirty-one peers, of whom Lord Monteagle was one. In 1598, as Mr.
    Atkinson tells us in his preface to the lately published volume of the <i>Calendar of
    Irish State Papers</i>, the cellars of the Dublin Law Courts were used as a powder
    magazine. The English Privy Council, startled to hear of this remarkable arrangement,
    pointed out that it might probably further diminish the number of loyal subjects in
    that kingdom, but were quaintly reassured by the Irish Lords Justices, who explained
    that, in view of the troublous state of the times, the sittings of the courts had
    been discontinued, and were not likely to be resumed for the present.</p>

    <p class="ni"><sup><a name="FN277" id="FN277"></a><a href="#FN277A">[277]</a></sup>
    The only allusion to it I have been able to find occurs in the <i>Politician's

    reliques, and were often shown to the king and his posterity, that they might not
    entertain the least thought of clemency towards the Catholique Religion. There is not
    an ignorant Minister or Tub-preacher, who doth not (when all other matter fails)
    remit his auditors to the Gunpowder Treason, and describe those tubs very
    pathetically, the only reliques thought fit by them to be kept in memory."</p>

    have already remarked upon Faukes' statement that he was arrested in quite a
    different place from any mentioned in the government accounts. It should be added,
    that as to the person who arrested him, there is a somewhat similar discrepancy of
    evidence. The honour is universally assigned by the official accounts to Sir T.
    Knyvet, who in the following year was created a peer, which shows that he undoubtedly
    rendered some valuable service on the occasion. An epitaph, however, in St. Anne's
    Church, Aldersgate (printed in Maitland's <i>History of London</i>, p. 1065, 3rd
    ed.), declares that it was Peter Heiwood, of Heywood, Lancashire, "who apprehended
    Guy Faux, with his dark Lanthorn; and for his zealous Prosecution of Papists, as
    Justice of Peace, was stabbed, in Westminster Hall, by John James, a Dominican Friar,
    <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1640." No trace of this assassination can be found,
    nor does the name of John James occur in the Dominican records. It is, however, a
    curious coincidence that the "Guy Faukes' Lantern," exhibited in the Ashmolean Museum
    at Oxford, bears the inscription: "<i>Laterna ilia ipsa qu&acirc; usus est, et cum
    qua deprehensus Guido Faux in crypt&acirc; subterrane&acirc;, ubi domo</i> [sic]

    The Council appears at this time to have met in the Painted Chamber, and, without at
    all wishing to lay too much stress upon this point, I cannot but remark that the
    supposition that this was the original scene assigned to the operations of Faukes
    would solve various difficulties:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Beneath the Painted Chamber was a vaulted cellar, answering to the description
      we have so frequently heard, whereas under the House of Lords was neither a cellar
      nor a vault.</li>

      <li>This crypt beneath the Painted Chamber has been constantly shown as "Guy
      Faukes' Cellar."</li>

      <li>In prints of the period, Faukes is usually represented as going to blow up this
      chamber, never the House of Lords.</li>

    Thus M. Bouillet, in the latest edition of his <i>Dictionnaire d'histoire et

    In connection with this appears an interesting example of the natural philosophy of
    the time, it being said that Faukes selected this mode of escape, hoping that water,
    being a non-conductor, would save him from the effects of the explosion.</p>

    am informed on high authority that on the day in question it was high water at London
    Bridge between five and six p.m. In his <i>Memorials of the Tower of London</i> (p.
    136) Lord de Ros says that the vessel destined to convey him to Flanders was to be in
    waiting for Faukes at the river side close by, and that in it he was to drop down the
    river with the ebb tide. It would, of course, have been impossible for any sea-going
    craft to make its way up to Westminster; nor would the ebb tide run to order.</p>

    <p class="ni"><sup><a name="FN291" id="FN291"></a><a href="#FN291A">[291]</a></sup>
    It is frequently said that the testimony of Bishop Goodman, who has been so often
    cited, is discredited by the fact that he probably died a Catholic, for he was
    attended on his death-bed by the Dominican Father, Francis &agrave; S. Clara
    (Christopher Davenport), chaplain to Queen Henrietta Maria, a learned man who
    indulged in the dream of corporate reunion between England and Rome, maintaining that
    the Anglican articles were in accordance with Catholic doctrine.</p>

    <p>In his will Goodman professed that as he lived, so he died, most constant in all
    the articles of the Christian Faith, and in all the doctrine of God's holy Catholic
    and Apostolic Church, "whereof," he says, "I do acknowledge the Church of Rome to be
    the Mother Church. And I do verily believe that no other church hath any salvation in
    it, but only so far as it concurs with the faith of the Church of Rome." On this, Mr.
    Brewer, his editor, observes that a sound Protestant might profess as much, the
    question being what meaning is to be given to the terms employed. Moreover, the same
    writer continues, Goodman cannot have imagined that his life had been a constant
    profession of Roman doctrine, inasmuch as he advanced steadily from one preferment to
    another in the Church of England, and strongly maintaining her doctrines formally
    denounced those of Rome. What is certain, however, is this, that in the very work
    from which his evidence is quoted he speaks in such a manner as to show that whatever
    were his religious opinions, he was a firm believer in the Royal Supremacy and a
    lover of King James, whom he thus describes: "Truly I did never know any man of so
    great an apprehension, of so great love and affection,&mdash;a man so truly just, so
    free from all cruelty and pride, such a lover of the church, and one that had done so
    much good for the church." (<i>Court of King James</i>, i. 91.)</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

  <h3>PERCY, CATESBY, AND TRESHAM.</h3>

  <p class="ni"><span class="smcap">On</span> occasion of a notorious trial in the Star
  Chamber, in the year 1604,<sup><a name="FN292A" id="FN292A"></a><a href=
  "#FN292">[292]</a></sup> Bancroft, the Archbishop of Canterbury, made the significant
  observation<sup><a name="FN293A" id="FN293A"></a><a href="#FN293">[293]</a></sup> that
  nothing was to be discovered concerning the Catholics "but by putting some Judas
  amongst them." That amongst the Powder Plot conspirators there was some one who played
  such a part, who perhaps even acted as a decoy-duck to lure the others to destruction,
  has always been suspected, but with sundry differences of opinion as to which of the
  band it was. Francis Tresham has most commonly been supposed at least to have sent the
  warning letter to Monteagle, which proved fatal to himself and his comrades: some
  writers have conjectured that he did a good deal more.<sup><a name="FN294A" id=
  "FN294A"></a><a href="#FN294">[294]</a></sup> Monteagle himself, as we have seen, has
  been supposed by others to have been in the Plot and to have betrayed it. It would
  appear, however, that neither of these has so strong a claim to this equivocal
  distinction as one whose name has been scarcely mentioned hitherto in such a
  connection.</p>

  <p>The part played in the conspiracy by Thomas <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148"
  id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>Percy is undoubtedly very singular, and the more so
  when we learn something of the history and character of the man. Till within some three
  years previously<sup><a name="FN295A" id="FN295A"></a><a href="#FN295">[295]</a></sup>
  he had been a Protestant, and, moreover, unusually wild and dissolute. After his
  conversion, he acquired the character of a zealous, if turbulent, Catholic, and is so
  described, not only by Father Gerard and Father Greenway, but by himself. In a letter
  written so late as November 2nd, 1605,<sup><a name="FN296A" id="FN296A"></a><a href=
  "#FN296">[296]</a></sup> he represents that he has to leave Yorkshire, being threatened
  by the Archbishop with arrest, "as the chief pillar of papistry in that county."</p>

  <p>It unfortunately appears that all the time this zealous convert was a bigamist,
  having one wife living in the capital and another in the provinces. When his name was
  published in connection with the Plot, the magistrates of London arrested the one, and
  those of Warwickshire the other, alike reporting to the secretary what they had done,
  as may be seen in the State Paper Office.<sup><a name="FN297A" id="FN297A"></a><a href=
  "#FN297">[297]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Gravely suspicious as such a fact must appear in connection with one professing
  exceptional religious fervour, it by no means stands alone. Father Greenway, in
  describing the character of Percy,<sup><a name="FN298A" id="FN298A"></a><a href=
  "#FN298">[298]</a></sup> dwells much on his sensitiveness to the suspicion of having
  played false to his fellow Catholics in his dealings with King <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span><span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>James in Scotland,
  coupled with protestations of his determination to do something to show that he as well
  as they had been deceived by that monarch. We find evidence that as a fact some
  Catholics distrusted him, as in the examination of one Cary, who, being interrogated
  concerning the Powder Plot, protested that "Percy was no Papist but a
  Puritan."<sup><a name="FN299A" id="FN299A"></a><a href="#FN299">[299]</a></sup> There
  is likewise in the king's own book a strange and obscure reference to Percy as the
  possible author of the letter to Monteagle, one of the chief grounds for suspecting him
  being "his backwardness in religion." It would moreover appear that he was not a man
  who always impressed those favourably who had to do with him, for Chamberlain reminds
  his friend Carleton that the latter had ever considered him "a subtle, flattering,
  dangerous knave."<sup><a name="FN300A" id="FN300A"></a><a href=
  "#FN300">[300]</a></sup></p>

  <div class="figcenter c13">

    "800" alt="THOMAS PERCY." title="" /> <span class="caption"><span class=
    "smcap">thomas percy.</span></span>
  </div>

  <p>We have seen something of the extraordinary manner in which Percy transacted the
  business of hiring the house and "cellar," wholly unlike what we should expect from one
  whose main object was to escape observation, and that he brought to bear the influence
  of sundry Protestant gentlemen, amongst them Dudley Carleton himself,<sup><a name=
  "FN301A" id="FN301A"></a><a href="#FN301">[301]</a></sup> in order to obtain the
  desired lease. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg
  151]</a></span>We know, moreover, that various unfortunate accidents prevented the
  history of these negotiations from ever being fully told.</p>

  <p>Yet more remarkable is a piece of information supplied by Bishop Goodman, his
  authority being the eminent lawyer Sir Francis Moore, who, says he, "is beyond all
  exception."<sup><a name="FN302A" id="FN302A"></a><a href="#FN302">[302]</a></sup>
  Moore, having occasion during the period when the Plot was in progress to be out on
  business late at night, and going homeward to the Middle Temple at two in the morning,
  "several times he met Mr. Percy coming out of the great statesman's house, and wondered
  what his business should be there." Such wonder was certainly not unnatural, and must
  be shared by us. That a man who was ostensibly the life and soul of a conspiracy
  directed against the king's chief minister, even more than against the sovereign
  himself, should resort for conference with his intended victim at an hour when he was
  most likely to escape observation, is assuredly not the least extraordinary feature in
  this strange and tangled tale.</p>

  <p>Not less suspicious is another circumstance. Immediately before the fatal Fifth of
  November, Percy had been away in the north, and he returned to London only on the
  evening of Saturday, the 2nd. Of this return, Cecil, writing a week later,<sup><a name=
  "FN303A" id="FN303A"></a><a href="#FN303">[303]</a></sup> made a great mystery, as
  though the traitor's movements had been of a most stealthy and secret character, and
  declared <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>that
  the fact had been discovered from Faukes only with infinite difficulty, and after many
  denials. It happens, however, that amongst the State Papers is preserved a pass dated
  October 25th, issued by the Commissioners of the North, for Thomas Percy, posting to
  Court upon the king's especial service, and charging all mayors, sheriffs, and
  postmasters to provide him with three good horses all along the road.<sup><a name=
  "FN304A" id="FN304A"></a><a href="#FN304">[304]</a></sup> It is manifestly absurd to
  speak of secrecy or stealth in connection with such a journey, or to pretend that the
  Chief Secretary of State could have any difficulty in tracing the movements of a man
  who travelled in this fashion; and protestations of ignorance serve only to show that
  to seem ignorant was thought desirable.</p>

  <p>Considerations like these, it will hardly be denied, countenance the notion that
  Percy was, in King James's own phrase, a tame duck employed to catch wild ones. Against
  such a supposition, however, a grave objection at once presents itself. Percy was
  amongst the very first victims of the enterprise, being one of the four who were killed
  at Holbeche when the conspirators were brought to bay.</p>

  <p>This, unquestionably, must at first sight appear to be fatal to the theory of his
  complicity, and the importance of such a fact should not be extenuated. At the same
  time, on further scrutiny, the argument which it supplies loses much of its force.</p>

  <p>It must, in the first place, be remembered, that according to the belief then
  current, it was no uncommon thing, as Lord Castlemaine expresses it<sup><a name=
  "FN305A" id="FN305A"></a><a href="#FN305">[305]</a></sup> the game being secured, to
  hang the spaniel which caught <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id=
  "Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>it, that its master's art might not appear, and, to cite
  no other instance, we have the example of Dr. Parry, who, as Mr. Brewer
  acknowledges,<sup><a name="FN306A" id="FN306A"></a><a href="#FN306">[306]</a></sup> was
  involved in the ruin of those whom he had been engaged to lure to destruction.</p>

  <p>There are, moreover, various remarkable circumstances in regard to the case of Percy
  in particular. It was observed at the time as strange and suspicious that any of the
  rebels should have been slain at all, for they were almost defenceless, having no
  fire-arms; they did not succeed in killing a single one of their assailants, and might
  all have been captured without difficulty. Nevertheless, the attacking party were not
  only allowed to shoot, but selected just the wrong men as their mark, precisely those
  who, being chiefly implicated in the beginnings of the Plot, could have afforded the
  most valuable information,<sup><a name="FN307A" id="FN307A"></a><a href=
  "#FN307">[307]</a></sup> for besides Percy, were shot down Catesby and the two
  Wrights,<sup><a name="FN308A" id="FN308A"></a><a href="#FN308">[308]</a></sup> all
  deeply <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg
  154]</a></span>implicated from the first. So unaccountable did such a course appear as
  at once to suggest sinister interpretations&mdash;especially as regarded the case of
  Percy and Catesby, who were always held to be the ringleaders of the band. As Goodman
  tells us,<sup><a name="FN309A" id="FN309A"></a><a href="#FN309">[309]</a></sup> "Some
  will not stick to report that the great statesman sending to apprehend these traitors
  gave special charge and direction for Percy and Catesby, 'Let me never see them alive;'
  who it may be would have revealed some evil counsel given." A similar suspicion seems
  to be insinuated by Sir Edward Hoby, writing to Edmondes, the Ambassador at
  Brussels<sup><a name="FN310A" id="FN310A"></a><a href="#FN310">[310]</a></sup>: "Percy
  is dead: who it is thought by some particular men could have said more than any
  other."</p>

  <p>More suspicious still appears the fact that the king's government thought it
  necessary to explain how it had come to pass that Percy was not secured alive, and to
  protest that they had been anxious above all for his capture, but had been frustrated
  by the inconsiderate zeal of their subordinates. In the "King's Book" we read as
  follows: "Although divers of the King's Proclamations were posted down after those
  Traitors with all speed possible, declaring the odiousness of that bloody attempt, and
  the necessity to have Percy preserved alive, if it had been possible, ... yet the far
  distance of the way (which was above an hundred miles), together with the extreme
  deepness thereof, joined also with the shortness of the day, was <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>the cause that the hearty
  and loving affection of the King's good subjects in those parts prevented the speed of
  his Proclamations."</p>

  <p>Such an explanation cannot be deemed satisfactory. The distance to be covered was
  about 112 miles, and there were three days to do it, for not till November 8th were the
  fugitives surrounded. They in their flight had the same difficulties to contend with,
  as are here enumerated, yet they accomplished their journey in a single day, and they
  had not, like the king's couriers, fresh horses ready for them at every post.</p>

  <p>But we have positive evidence upon this point. Father Greenway, who was at the time
  in the Midlands, close to the scene of action, incidentally mentions, without any
  reference to our present question,<sup><a name="FN311A" id="FN311A"></a><a href=
  "#FN311">[311]</a></sup> that while the rebels were in the field, messengers came post
  haste continually, one after the other, from the capital, all bearing proclamations
  mentioning Percy by name.</p>

  <p>It must also be observed that though the couriers, we are told, could not in three
  days get from London to Holbeche to hinder Percy's death, they contrived to ride in one
  from Holbeche to London with news that he was dead.<sup><a name="FN312A" id=
  "FN312A"></a><a href="#FN312">[312]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Another circumstance not easy to explain is, that the man who killed Percy and
  Catesby,<sup><a name="FN313A" id="FN313A"></a><a href="#FN313">[313]</a></sup> John
  Streete by name, received for his service the handsome pension of two shillings a day
  for life, equal at least to a pound of our present money.<sup><a name="FN314A" id=
  "FN314A"></a><a href="#FN314">[314]</a></sup> This is certainly a large <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>reward for having done
  the very thing that the government most desired to avoid, and for an action, moreover,
  involving no sort of personal risk, killing two practically unarmed men from behind a
  tree.<sup><a name="FN315A" id="FN315A"></a><a href="#FN315">[315]</a></sup> If,
  however, he had silenced a dangerous witness, it is easy to understand the munificence
  of his recompense.</p>

  <p>Against Catesby, likewise, there are serious indictments, and it seems impossible to
  believe him to have been, as commonly represented, a man, however blinded by
  fanaticism, yet honest in his bad enterprise, who would not stoop to fraud or untruth.
  It is abundantly evident that on many occasions he deliberately deceived his
  associates, and those whom he called his spiritual guides, making promises which he did
  not mean to keep, and giving assurances which he knew to be false.<sup><a name="FN316A"
  id="FN316A"></a><a href="#FN316">[316]</a></sup> It will be sufficient to quote one or
  two examples quite sufficient to stamp him as a man utterly unscrupulous about the
  means employed to gain his ends.</p>

  <p>On the 5th of November, when, after the failure of the enterprise, he arrived at
  Dunchurch, in Warwickshire, Catesby, in order to induce Sir Everard Digby to commit
  himself to the hopeless campaign now to be undertaken, assured him,<sup><a name=
  "FN317A" id="FN317A"></a><a href="#FN317">[317]</a></sup> that though the powder was
  discovered, yet the king and Salisbury were killed; all were in "a pother;" the
  Catholics were sure to rise in a body, one family alone, the Littletons, would bring in
  one thousand men the next day; and so on,&mdash;all <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>this being absolutely untrue. That he had
  previously employed similar means on a large scale to inveigle his friends into his
  atrocious and senseless scheme, there is much evidence, strongest of all that of Father
  Garnet;<sup><a name="FN318A" id="FN318A"></a><a href="#FN318">[318]</a></sup> "I doubt
  not that Mr. Catesby hath feigned many such things for to induce others."</p>

  <p>Worst of all, we learn from another intercepted letter of Garnet's, Catesby had for
  his own purposes circulated an atrocious slander against Garnet himself, although
  passing as his devoted disciple and friend: "Master Catesby," he wrote,<sup><a name=
  "FN319A" id="FN319A"></a><a href="#FN319">[319]</a></sup> "did me much wrong, and hath
  confessed that he told them he asked me a question in Q. Elizabeth's time of the powder
  action,<sup><a name="FN320A" id="FN320A"></a><a href="#FN320">[320]</a></sup> and that
  I said it was lawful. All which is most untrue. He did it to draw in others."</p>

  <p>In view of this, and much else of a similar kind, it is difficult to read Father
  Gerard's <i>Narrative</i>, and more particularly Father Greenway's additions thereto,
  without a growing feeling that if Catesby sought counsel it was with no intention of
  being guided by it, and that his sole desire was to get hold of something which might
  serve his own purposes.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

  <p>We have already seen that a great deal of mystery attaches to Francis Tresham, who
  is generally supposed to have written the letter to Monteagle, and was clearly
  suspected by some of having done a great deal more; for the author of the
  <i>Politician's Catechism</i> speaks of him as having access to Cecil's house even at
  midnight, along with another whose name is not given, these two being therefore
  supposed to have been the secretary's instruments in all this business. What is certain
  is, that Tresham did not fly like the rest when the "discovery" had taken place, not
  only remaining in London, and showing himself openly in the streets, but actually
  presenting himself to the council, and offering them his services. Moreover, though his
  name was known to the government, at least on November 7th, as one of the accomplices,
  it was for several days omitted from their published proclamations, and not till the
  12th was he taken into custody. Being confined in the Tower, he was shortly attacked by
  a painful malady, and on December 23rd he died, as was officially announced, of a
  "strangury," as Salisbury assures Cornwallis "by a natural sickness, such as he hath
  been a long time subject to."<sup><a name="FN321A" id="FN321A"></a><a href=
  "#FN321">[321]</a></sup> Throughout his sickness he himself and his friends loudly
  declared that should he survive it "they feared not the course of
  justice."<sup><a name="FN322A" id="FN322A"></a><a href="#FN322">[322]</a></sup> Such
  confidence, as Mr. Jardine remarks, could be grounded only on his possession of
  knowledge which the authorities would not venture to reveal, and it is not surprising
  that his death should have been attributed, by the enemies of the government, to
  poison. It is no doubt an argument against <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id=
  "Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>such a supposition that during his illness Tresham was
  allowed to be attended by his wife and a confidential servant. On the other hand, not
  only does Bishop Goodman inform us<sup><a name="FN323A" id="FN323A"></a><a href=
  "#FN323">[323]</a></sup> that "Butler, the great physician of Cambridge," declared him
  to have been poisoned; but the author of <i>Mischeefes Mystery</i>, a violent
  government partisan, contradicts the notion of a natural death, by asserting that
  "Tresham murthered himself in the Tower."</p>

  <p>It thus appears, once again, that the more its details are scrutinized, the less
  does the traditional history of the Plot commend itself to our acceptance. It is hard
  to believe that within the ranks of the conspirators themselves, there was no
  treachery, no one who, lending himself to work the ruin of his associates, unwittingly
  wrought his own.</p>
  <hr class='c14' />

  <p>The evidence hitherto considered may fitly conclude with the testimony of a witness
  living near the time in question, who had evidently been at pains to make inquiries
  amongst those most likely to give information. This is an anonymous correspondent of
  Anthony &agrave; Wood, whose notes are preserved in Fulman's collection in the library
  of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. These remarkable notes have been seen by Fulman, who
  inserted in the margin various questions and objections, to which the writer always
  supplied precise and definite replies. In the following version this supplementary
  information is incorporated in the body of his statement, being distinguished by
  italics. The writer, who explains that his full materials are in the country, speaks
  thus:<sup><a name="FN324A" id="FN324A"></a><a href="#FN324">[324]</a></sup></p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

  <p>"I should be glad to understand what your friend driveth at about the Fifth of
  November. It was, without all peradventure, a State Plot. I have collected many
  pregnant circumstances concerning it.</p>

  <p>"'Tis certain that the last Earl of Salisbury<sup><a name="FN325A" id=
  "FN325A"></a><a href="#FN325">[325]</a></sup> confessed to William Lenthal<sup><a name=
  "FN326A" id="FN326A"></a><a href="#FN326">[326]</a></sup> it was his father's
  contrivance, which Lenthal soon after told one Mr. Webb (<i>John Webb, Esq.</i>), a
  person of quality, and his kinsman, yet alive.</p>

  <p>"Sir Henry Wotton says 'twas usual with Cecil to create plots, that he might have
  the honour of the discovery, or to such effect.</p>

  <p>"The Lord Mounteagle knew there was a letter to be sent to him before it came.
  (<i>Known by Edmund Church, Esq., his confidant.</i>)</p>

  <p>"Sir Everard Digby's sons were both knighted soon after, and Sir Kenelm would often
  say it was a State design, to disengage the king of his promise to the Pope and the
  King of Spain, to indulge the Catholics if ever he came to be king here; and somewhat
  to his purpose was found in the Lord Wimbledon's papers after his death.<sup><a name=
  "FN327A" id="FN327A"></a><a href="#FN327">[327]</a></sup></p>

  <p>"Mr. Vowell, who was executed in the Rump time, did also affirm it so.<sup><a name=
  "FN328A" id="FN328A"></a><a href="#FN328">[328]</a></sup></p>

  <p>"Catesby's man (<i>George Bartlet</i>),<sup><a name="FN329A" id=
  "FN329A"></a><a href="#FN329">[329]</a></sup> on his death-bed, <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>confessed his master went
  to Salisbury House several nights before the discovery, and was always brought
  privately in at a back door."</p>

  <p>Then, in answer to an objection of Fulman's, is added: "Catesby, 'tis like, did not
  mean to betray his friends or his own life&mdash;he was drawn in and made believe
  strange things. All good men condemn him and the rest as most desperate wretches; yet
  most believed the original contrivance of the Plot was not theirs."</p>

  <p>Whatever else may be thought of the above statements, they at least serve to
  contradict Mr. Jardine's assertion,<sup><a name="FN330A" id="FN330A"></a><a href=
  "#FN330">[330]</a></sup> that the notion of Cecil's complicity,&mdash;which he terms a
  strange suggestion, scarce worthy of notice,&mdash;was first heard of long after the
  transaction, and was adopted exclusively by Catholics. Clearly it was not unknown to
  Protestants who were contemporaries, or personally acquainted with contemporaries, of
  the event. Yet the document here cited was known to Mr. Jardine, who mentions one of
  its statements, that relating to Lord Monteagle, but says nothing of its more serious
  allegations.</p>

  <p>It must also be remarked that we find some traces in the evidence which remains of
  certain mysterious conspirators of great importance, concerning whom no investigation
  whatever appears to have been made, they being at once permitted to drop into the
  profoundest obscurity, in a manner quite contrary to the habitual practice of the
  authorities.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

  <p>One such instance is afforded by the testimony of a mariner, Henry Paris, of
  Barking,<sup><a name="FN331A" id="FN331A"></a><a href="#FN331">[331]</a></sup> that Guy
  Faukes, <i>alias</i> Johnson, hired a boat of him, "wherein was carried over to
  Gravelines a man supposed of great import: he went disguised, and would not suffer any
  one man to go with him but this Vaux, nor to return with him. This Paris did attend for
  him back at Gravelines six weeks. If cause require there are several proofs of this
  matter." None of these, however, seem to have been sought.</p>

    The case of Carleton is not without mystery. At the time of the discovery he was at
    Paris, as secretary to the English ambassador, but about the middle of the month was
    ordered home in hot haste and placed "in restraint." On February 28th, 1605-6, he
    wrote to his friend Chamberlain that he was airing himself on the Chilterns to get
    rid of the scent of powder, asking his correspondent to consult a patron as to his
    best means of promotion (<i>Dom. James I.</i> xviii. 125). Far from being injured by
    any suspicion that he might seem to have incurred, he subsequently rose rapidly in
    favour, was intrusted with most important diplomatic missions, and was finally
    created Viscount Dorchester.</p>

    author of the <i>Politician's Catechism</i> writes: "It is very certaine that Percy

    well that these two unfortunate Gentlemen would have related the story lesse to his
    owne advantage, than himself caused it to be published: therefore they were
    dispatched when they might have been made prisoners, having no other weapons,
    offensive or defensive, but their swords."</p>

    About the death of the Wrights there are extraordinary contradictions. In the
    "original" of his famous confession T. Winter says: "The next shot was the elder
    Wright, stone dead; after him the younger Mr. Wright." In <i>Mischeefes Mystery</i>
    we read that Percy and Catesby were killed "with a gunne," the two Wrights "with
    Halberts." The day after the attack, November 9th, Sir Edward Leigh wrote to the
    Council, that the Wrights were not slain, as reputed, but wounded. Not till the 13th
    was their death certified by Sir Richard Walsh.</p>

    The strange story of a powder-plot under Elizabeth is variously told. According to
    one of the mysterious confessions attributed to Faukes, which have disappeared from
    the State Papers, Owen told him in Flanders that one Thomas Morgan had proposed to
    blow up her majesty (Abbot, <i>Antilogia</i>, 137). The <i>Memorial to
    Protestants</i> by Bishop Kennet (1713) says that the man's name was Moody, who
    wanted the French ambassador to subsidise him. The idea was to place a 20 lb. bag of
    powder under the queen's bed, and explode it in the middle of the night, but how this
    was to be managed is not explained.</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

  <h3>THE GOVERNMENT'S CASE.</h3>

  <p class="ni"><span class="smcap">We</span> have hitherto confined our attention to
  sources of information other than those with which the authors of the official
  narrative have supplied us, and upon which they based the same. It remains to inquire
  how far the evidence presented by them can avail to substantiate the traditional
  history, and to rebut the various arguments against its authenticity which have been
  adduced.</p>

  <p>For brevity and clearness' sake it will be advisable to divide this investigation
  under several heads.</p>

  <h4>i. <i>The Trial of the Conspirators.</i></h4>

  <p>On the threshold of our inquiry we are met by a most singular and startling fact. As
  to what passed on the trial of the conspirators, what evidence was produced against
  them, how it was supported,&mdash;nay, even how the tale of their enterprise was
  told&mdash;we have no information upon which any reliance can be placed. One version
  alone has come down to us of the proceedings upon this occasion&mdash;that published
  "by authority"&mdash;and of this we can be sure only that it is utterly untrustworthy.
  It was issued under the title of the <i>True and Perfect Relation</i>, but, as Mr.
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>Jardine has
  already told us, is certainly not deserving of the character which its title imports.
  "It is not true, because many occurrences on the trial are wilfully misrepresented; and
  it is not <i>perfect</i>, because the whole evidence, and many facts and circumstances
  which must have happened, are omitted, and incidents are inserted which could not by
  possibility have taken place on the occasion. It is obviously a false and imperfect
  relation of the proceedings; a tale artfully garbled and misrepresented ... to serve a
  State purpose, and intended and calculated to mislead the judgment of the world upon
  the facts of the case."<sup><a name="FN332A" id="FN332A"></a><a href=
  "#FN332">[332]</a></sup> Again the same author remarks,<sup><a name="FN333A" id=
  "FN333A"></a><a href="#FN333">[333]</a></sup> "that every line of the published trial
  was rigidly weighed and considered, not with reference to its accuracy, but its effect
  on the minds of those who might read it, is manifest."</p>

  <p>Moreover, the narrative thus obviously dishonest, was admittedly issued in
  contradiction of divers others already passing "from hand to hand," which were at
  variance with itself in points of importance, and which it stigmatized as "uncertain,
  untrue, and incoherent;" it justified its appearance on the ground that it was
  supremely important for the public to be rightly informed in such a case:<sup><a name=
  "FN334A" id="FN334A"></a><a href="#FN334">[334]</a></sup> and so successful were the
  efforts made to secure for it a monopoly, that no single document has come down to us
  by which its statements <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg
  165]</a></span>might be checked. In consequence, to quote Mr. Jardine once
  more,<sup><a name="FN335A" id="FN335A"></a><a href="#FN335">[335]</a></sup> there is no
  trial since the time of Henry VIII. in regard of which we are so ignorant as to what
  actually occurred.<sup><a name="FN336A" id="FN336A"></a><a href=
  "#FN336">[336]</a></sup></p>

  <p>The employment of methods such as these would in any circumstances forfeit all
  credit on behalf of the story thus presented. In the present instance the presumption
  raised against it is even stronger than it would commonly be. If the Gunpowder Plot
  were in reality what was represented, why was it deemed necessary, in Cecil's own
  phrase, to pervert and disguise its history in order to produce the desired effect? A
  project so singular and diabolical in its atrocity, prepared for on so large a scale,
  and so nearly successful, should, it would appear, have needed no fictitious adjuncts
  to enhance its enormity; and for the conviction of miscreants caught red-handed in such
  an enterprise no evidence should have been so effectual as that furnished by the facts
  of the case, which of their nature should have been patent and unquestionable. When we
  find, on the contrary, a web <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg
  166]</a></span>of falsehood and mystery woven with elaborate care over the whole
  history of the transaction, it is not unnatural to infer that to have told the simple
  truth would not have suited the purpose of those who had the telling of the tale; and
  it is obviously necessary that the evidence whereby their story was supported should be
  rigorously sifted.</p>

  <p>What has been said, though in great measure true of the trial of Father Garnet, at
  the end of March, is especially applicable to that of the conspirators, two months
  earlier, for in regard of this we have absolutely no information beyond that officially
  supplied. The execution of Faukes and his companions following close upon their
  arraignment,<sup><a name="FN337A" id="FN337A"></a><a href="#FN337">[337]</a></sup> all
  that had been elicited, or was said to have been elicited, at their trial, became
  henceforth evidence which could not be contradicted, the prosecution thus having a free
  hand in dealing with their subsequent victim.<sup><a name="FN338A" id=
  "FN338A"></a><a href="#FN338">[338]</a></sup> In view of this circumstance it has been
  noted as remarkable that whereas the conspirators had been kept alive and untried for
  nearly three months, they were thus summarily dealt with at the moment when it was
  known that the capture of Father Garnet was imminent, and, as a matter of fact, he was
  taken on the very day on which the first company were executed.<sup><a name="FN339A"
  id="FN339A"></a><a href="#FN339">[339]</a></sup> It would <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>appear that nothing
  should have seemed more desirable than to confront the Jesuit superior with those whom
  he was declared to have instigated to their crime, instead of putting them out of the
  way at the very moment when there was a prospect of doing so.</p>

  <h4>ii. <i>The Fundamental Evidence.</i></h4>

  <p>Amongst all the confessions and "voluntary declarations" extracted from the
  conspirators, there are two of exceptional importance, as having furnished the basis of
  the story told by the government, and ever since generally accepted. These are a long
  declaration made by Thomas Winter, and another by Guy Faukes, which alone were made
  public, being printed in the "King's Book," and from which are gathered the essential
  particulars of the story as we are accustomed to hear it.</p>

  <p>Of Winter's declaration, which is in the form of a letter to the Lords
  Commissioners, there is found in the State Paper Office only a copy, bearing date
  November 23rd, 1605, in the handwriting of Levinus Munck, Cecil's private secretary.
  This copy has been shown to the King, who in a marginal note objects to a certain
  "uncleare phrase," which has accordingly been altered in accordance with the royal
  criticism: <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg
  168]</a></span>and from it has evidently been taken the printed version, which agrees
  with it in every respect, including the above-mentioned emendation of the
  phraseology.</p>

  <div class="figcenter c7">
    <a name="image19" id="image19"></a><img src="images/image19.png" width="600" height=
    "104" alt="FROM WINTER'S CONFESSION, NOVEMBER 23." title="" /> <span class=
    "caption"><span class="smcap">from winter's confession, november 23.</span></span>
  </div>

  <p>It must strike the reader as remarkable that, whereas, as has been said, the body of
  the letter is in the handwriting of the secretary, Munck, the names of the witnesses
  who attest it<sup><a name="FN340A" id="FN340A"></a><a href="#FN340">[340]</a></sup> are
  added in that of his master, Cecil himself.</p>

  <p>The "original" document, in Winter's own hand, is at Hatfield, and agrees in general
  so exactly with the copy, as to demonstrate the identity of their origin.<sup><a name=
  "FN341A" id="FN341A"></a><a href="#FN341">[341]</a></sup> But while, as we have seen,
  the "copy" is dated November 23rd, the "original" is dated on the 25th.<sup><a name=
  "FN342A" id="FN342A"></a><a href="#FN342">[342]</a></sup> On a circumstance so
  singular, light is possibly thrown by a letter from Waad, the Lieutenant of the Tower,
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>to Cecil, on
  the 21st of the same month.<sup><a name="FN343A" id="FN343A"></a><a href=
  "#FN343">[343]</a></sup> "Thomas Winter," he wrote, "doth find his hand so strong, as
  after dinner he will settle himself to write that he hath verbally declared to your
  Lordship, adding what he shall remember." The inference is certainly suggested that
  torture had been used until the prisoner's spirit was sufficiently broken to be ready
  to tell the story required of him, and that the details were furnished by those who
  demanded it. It must, moreover, be remarked that although Winter's "original"
  declaration is witnessed only by Sir E. Coke, the Attorney General, it appears in print
  attested by all those whom Cecil had selected for the purpose two days before the
  declaration was made.<sup><a name="FN344A" id="FN344A"></a><a href=
  "#FN344">[344]</a></sup> It may be said that the inference drawn above is violent and
  unfair, and, perhaps, were there no other case to go upon but that of Winter, so grave
  a charge as it implies should not be made. There remains, however, the companion case
  of Faukes, which is yet more extraordinary.</p>

  <p>His declaration first makes its appearance as "The examination of Guy Fawkes, taken
  the 8th of November."<sup><a name="FN345A" id="FN345A"></a><a href=
  "#FN345">[345]</a></sup> The document thus described is manifestly a draft, and not a
  copy of a deposition actually taken. It is unsigned: the list of witnesses is in the
  same handwriting as the rest, and in no instance is a witness indicated by such a title
  as he would employ for his signature.<sup><a name="FN346A" id="FN346A"></a><a href=
  "#FN346">[346]</a></sup> Throughout this paper Faukes is made to <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>speak in the third
  person, and the names of accomplices to whom he refers are not given.</p>

  <p>What, however, is most remarkable is the frank manner in which this document is
  treated as a draft. Several passages are cancelled and others substituted, sometimes in
  quite a contrary sense, so that the same deponent cannot possibly have made the
  statements contained in both versions. Other paragraphs are "ticked off," as the event
  proves, for omission.</p>

  <p>Nine days later, November 17th,<sup><a name="FN347A" id="FN347A"></a><a href=
  "#FN347">[347]</a></sup> Faukes was induced to put his name to the substance of the
  matter contained in the draft.<sup><a name="FN348A" id="FN348A"></a><a href=
  "#FN348">[348]</a></sup> The document is headed "The declaration<sup><a name="FN349A"
  id="FN349A"></a><a href="#FN349">[349]</a></sup> of Guy Fawkes, prisoner in the Tower
  of London." Faukes speaks throughout in the first person, and supplies the names
  previously omitted.<sup><a name="FN350A" id="FN350A"></a><a href=
  "#FN350">[350]</a></sup> Most noteworthy is the manner in which this <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>version is adapted to the
  emendations of the draft. The passages ticked off have disappeared entirely, amongst
  them the remarkable statements that "they [the confederates] meant also to have sent
  for the prisoners in the Tower, of whom particularly they had some
  consultation,"&mdash;that "they had consultation for the taking of the Lady Mary [the
  infant daughter of King James] into their possession"&mdash;and that "provision was
  made by some of the conspiracy of armour of proof this last summer, for this action."
  Where an alteration has been made in the draft, great skill is shown in combining what
  is important in both versions.<sup><a name="FN351A" id="FN351A"></a><a href=
  "#FN351">[351]</a></sup></p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

  <p>As to the means which were employed to compel Faukes to sign the declaration there
  can be no doubt; his signature bearing evidence that he had been tortured with extreme
  severity. The witnesses are but two, Coke, the Attorney General, and Waad, the
  Lieutenant of the Tower. When, however, the document came to be printed, as in the
  other case, a fuller list was appended, but not exactly that previously indicated, for
  to Faukes were assigned the same witnesses as to Winter, including the Earls of
  Worcester and Dunbar over and above his own list.<sup><a name="FN352A" id=
  "FN352A"></a><a href="#FN352">[352]</a></sup></p>

  </div>

  <p>The printed version exhibits other points of interest. There was in the Archduke's
  service, in Flanders, an <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg
  173]</a></span>English soldier, Hugh Owen,<sup><a name="FN354A" id=
  "FN354A"></a><a href="#FN354">[354]</a></sup> whom the government were for some reason,
  excessively desirous to incriminate, and get into their hands. For this purpose, a
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>passage was
  artfully interpolated in the statement of Faukes, whereof no trace is found in the
  original. In the "King's Book," the passage in question stands thus, the words
  italicised being those fraudulently introduced:</p>

  <p>"About Easter, the parliament being prorogued till October next, we dispersed
  ourselves, and I retired into the Low-countries, <i>by advice and direction of the
  rest; as well to acquaint Owen with the particulars of the plot, as also</i>, lest, by
  my longer stay, I might have grown suspicious." But of Owen we shall see more in
  particular. It must not be forgotten that on several other days besides those named
  above, Faukes made declarations, still extant, viz., November 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th, and
  16th, and January 9th and 20th. The most important items of information furnished by
  that selected for publication were not even hinted at in any of these.</p>

  <p>Farther light appears to be thrown on the manner in which this important declaration
  was prepared by another document found amongst the State Papers. This is an
  "interrogatory" drawn up by Sir E. Coke on November 8th, the very day of the "draft,"
  expressly for the benefit of Faukes.<sup><a name="FN355A" id="FN355A"></a><a href=
  "#FN355">[355]</a></sup> That the "draft" was composed from this appears to be shown by
  a curious piece of evidence. We have already noticed the strange phraseology of one of
  the passages attributed to Faukes: "He confesseth that the same day that this
  detestable act should have been performed the same day should other of their
  confederacy have surprised the person of the Lady Elizabeth," etc. <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>Precisely the same
  repetition occurs in the sixth of Mr. Attorney's suggested questions. "<i>Item</i>, was
  it not agreed that the same day that the act should have been done, the same day or
  soon after the person of the Lady Elizabeth should have been surprised," etc.?</p>

  <p>Moreover, it is apparent that this interrogatory is not founded on information
  already obtained, but is, in fact, what is known as a "fishing" document, intended to
  elicit evidence of some kind. In the first place, some of its suggestions are mutually
  incompatible. Thus in another place it implies that not Elizabeth but her infant sister
  Mary was the choice of the queen-makers:&mdash;"Who should have been protector of the
  Lady Mary, who, being born in England, they meant to prefer to the crown. With whom
  should she have married?" (She was then seven months old.) Again it asks: "What should
  have become of the Prince?" as though he might after all be the sovereign intended.</p>

  <p>Besides this, many points are raised which are evidently purely imaginary, inasmuch
  as no more was ever heard of them though if substantiated, they would have been
  supremely important.<sup><a name="FN356A" id="FN356A"></a><a href=
  "#FN356">[356]</a></sup></p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

  <p>The above details will not appear superfluous if the importance of these documents
  be fully understood. It is upon these narratives, stamped with features so incompatible
  with their trustworthiness, that we entirely depend for much of prime importance in the
  history of the conspiracy, in particular for the notable episode of the mine, which
  they alone relate, and which is not even mentioned, either in the other numerous
  confessions of Faukes and Winter themselves, or by any of the other confederates. Save
  for an incidental remark of Keyes, that he helped to work in the mine, we hear nothing
  else of it; while not only is this confession quite as strange a document as the two
  others, but, to complicate the matter still more, Keyes is expressly described by
  Cecil<sup><a name="FN357A" id="FN357A"></a><a href="#FN357">[357]</a></sup> himself as
  one of those that "wrought not in the mine."</p>

  <p>It is hard to understand how so remarkable an operation should have been totally
  ignored in all the other confessions and declarations, numerous and various as they
  are; while, on the other hand, should <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id=
  "Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>this striking feature of the Plot prove to be a
  fabrication, what is there of which to be certain?</p>

  <h4>iii. <i>The Confession of Thomas Bates (December 4th, 1605).</i></h4>

  <p>There is another piece of evidence to which exceptional prominence has been given,
  the confession of Thomas Bates, Catesby's servant, dated December 4th, 1605. This is
  the only one of the conspirators' confessions specifically mentioned in the government
  account of their trial, and it is mentioned twice over&mdash;a circumstance not
  unsuspicious in view of the nature of that account as already described.<sup><a name=
  "FN358A" id="FN358A"></a><a href="#FN358">[358]</a></sup></p>

  <p>It is not necessary at present to enter upon the large question of the attitude of
  the Jesuits towards the Plot, nor to discuss their guilt or innocence. This is,
  however, beyond dispute, that the government were above all things anxious to prove
  them guilty,<sup><a name="FN359A" id="FN359A"></a><a href="#FN359">[359]</a></sup> and
  no document ever produced was so effective for this purpose as the said confession,
  for, if it were true, there could be no question as to the guilt of one Jesuit, at
  least, Father Greenway <i>alias</i> Tesimond. The substance of Bates' declaration was
  as follows:</p>

  <p>That being introduced and sworn into the conspiracy by his master, Catesby, he was
  then told that, as a pledge of fidelity, he must receive the sacrament upon his oath,
  and accordingly he went to confession to Greenway, the Jesuit.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

  <p class="c6">That in his confession he fully informed Greenway of the design, and that
  Greenway bade him obey his master, because it was for a good cause, and be secret, and
  mention the matter to no other priest.</p>

  <p>That he was absolved by Greenway, and afterwards received Holy Communion.</p>

  <p>It will be observed that the second paragraph, here italicized, is of supreme
  importance. We have evidence that although the conspirators, during the course of their
  operations, frequented the sacraments, they expressly avoided all mention of their
  design to their confessors, Catesby having required this of them, assuring them that he
  had fully satisfied himself that the project, far from being sinful, was meritorious,
  but that the priests were likely to give trouble.<sup><a name="FN360A" id=
  "FN360A"></a><a href="#FN360">[360]</a></sup> We are even told by some authors that
  Catesby exacted of his confederates an oath of secrecy in this regard. It is clear that
  his authority must have had special weight with his own servant, who was, moreover,
  devotedly attached to his master, as he proved in the crisis of his fate. We might,
  therefore, naturally be prepared to learn that Bates, though confessing to Greenway,
  never acquainted him with the Plot; and, that in fact he never did so, there is some
  interesting evidence.</p>

  <p>It cannot escape observation as a suspicious circumstance <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>that this most important
  confession, upon which so much stress was laid, exists amongst the State Papers only in
  a copy.<sup><a name="FN361A" id="FN361A"></a><a href="#FN361">[361]</a></sup> Moreover,
  this copy has been treated as though it were an original, being officially endorsed,
  and it has on some occasion been used in Court.<sup><a name="FN362A" id=
  "FN362A"></a><a href="#FN362">[362]</a></sup> If, however, this version were not
  genuine, but prepared for a purpose, it is clear that it could not have been produced
  while Bates was alive to contradict it, and there appears to be no doubt that it was
  not heard of till after his death.</p>

  <p>This appears, in the first place, from a manuscript account of the
  Plot,<sup><a name="FN363A" id="FN363A"></a><a href="#FN363">[363]</a></sup> written
  between the trial of the conspirators and that of Father Garnet, that is, within two
  months of the former. The author sets himself expressly to prove that the priests must
  have been cognizant of the design, for, he argues, Catholics, when they have anything
  of the kind in hand, always consult their confessors about it, and it cannot be
  supposed that on this occasion only did they omit to do so. In support of his
  assertion, he quotes the instances of Parry, Babington, and Squires, but says nothing
  of Bates. He mentions Greenway as undoubtedly one of the guilty priests, but only
  because "his Majesty's proclamation so speaks it." Had the confession of Bates, as we
  have it, been so prominently adduced at the trial, as the official narrative
  represents, it is quite impossible that such a writer should have been content with
  these feeble inferences.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

  <p>Still more explicit is the evidence furnished by another MS. containing a report of
  Father Garnet's trial.<sup><a name="FN364A" id="FN364A"></a><a href=
  "#FN364">[364]</a></sup> In this the confession of Bates is cited, but precisely
  without the significant passage of which we have spoken, as follows: "Catesby
  afterwards discovered the project unto him; shortly after which discovery, Bates went
  to Mass to Tesimond [Greenway], and there was confessed and had absolution."</p>

  <p>Here, again, it is impossible to suppose that the all-important point was the one
  omitted. It is clear, however, that the mention of a confession made to Greenway would
  <i>prim&acirc; facie</i> afford a presumption that this particular matter had been
  confessed, thus furnishing a foundation whereon to build; and, knowing as we do how
  evidence was manipulated, it is quite conceivable that the copy now extant incorporates
  the improved version thus suggested.</p>

  <p>Such an explanation was unmistakably insinuated by Father Garnet, when, on his
  trial, this evidence was urged against him; for he significantly replied that "Bates
  was a dead man."<sup><a name="FN365A" id="FN365A"></a><a href="#FN365">[365]</a></sup>
  Greenway himself afterwards, when beyond danger, denied on his salvation that Bates had
  ever on any occasion mentioned to him any word concerning the Plot. It is still more
  singular that Bates himself appears to have known nothing of his own declaration. He
  had apparently said, in some examination of which no record remains, that he thought
  Greenway "knew of the business." This statement he afterwards retracted as having been
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>elicited by a
  vain hope of pardon, in a letter which is given in full by Father Gerard,<sup><a name=
  "FN366A" id="FN366A"></a><a href="#FN366">[366]</a></sup> and of which Cecil himself
  made mention at Garnet's trial.<sup><a name="FN367A" id="FN367A"></a><a href=
  "#FN367">[367]</a></sup> But of the far more serious accusation we are considering he
  said never a word.</p>

  <p>There is, however, evidence still more notable. On the same day, December 4th, on
  which Bates made his declaration, Cecil wrote a most important letter to one
  Favat,<sup><a name="FN368A" id="FN368A"></a><a href="#FN368">[368]</a></sup> who had
  been commissioned by King James to urge the necessity of obtaining evidence without
  delay against the priests. This document is valuable as furnishing explicit testimony
  that torture was employed with this object. "Most of the prisoners," says the
  secretary, "have wilfully forsworn that the priests knew anything in particular, and
  obstinately refuse to be accusers of them, yea, what torture soever they be put
  to."</p>

  <p>He goes on, however, to assure his Majesty that the desired object is now in sight,
  particularly referring to a confession which can be none other than that of Bates, but
  likewise cannot be that afterwards given to the world; for it is spoken of as affording
  promise, but not yet satisfactory in its performance.</p>

  <p>"You may tell his Majesty that if he please to read privately what this day we have
  drawn from a voluntary and penitent examination, the point I am persuaded (but I am no
  undertaker) shall be so well cleared, if he forbear to speak much of this but few days,
  as we shall see all fall out to the end whereat his Majesty shooteth."</p>

  <p>It seems clear, therefore, that the famous declaration <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>of Bates, like those of
  Faukes and Winter, tends to discredit the story which in particulars so important rests
  upon such evidence.</p>

  <p>It may be farther observed that if the confession of Bates, as officially preserved,
  were of any worth, it would have helped to raise other issues of supreme importance.
  Thus its concluding paragraph runs as follows:</p>

  <p>"He confesseth that he heard his master, Thomas Winter, and Guy Fawkes say
  (presently upon the coming over of Fawkes) that they should have the sum of
  five-and-twenty thousand pounds out of Spain."</p>

  <p>This clearly means that the King of Spain was privy to the design, for a sum
  equivalent to a quarter of a million of our money could not have been furnished by
  private persons. The government, however, constantly assured the English ambassadors
  abroad of the great satisfaction with which they found that no suspicion whatever
  rested upon any foreign prince.</p>

  <h4>iv. <i>Robert Winter.</i></h4>

  <p>There are various traces of foul play in regard of this conspirator in particular,
  which serve to shake our confidence as to the treatment of all. Robert Winter was the
  eldest brother of Thomas, and held the family property, which was considerable. Whether
  this motive, as Mr. Jardine suggests, or some other, prompted the step, certain it is
  that the government in their published history falsified the documents in order to
  incriminate him more deeply. Faukes, in the confession of Nov. 17th, mentioned Robert
  Keyes <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>as
  amongst the first seven of the conspirators who worked in the mine, and Robert Winter
  as one of the five introduced at a later period. The names of these two were
  deliberately interchanged in the published version, Robert Winter appearing as a worker
  in the mine, and Keyes, who was an obscure man of no substance, among the gentlemen of
  property whose resources were to have supported the subsequent rebellion. Moreover, in
  the account of the same confession sent to Edmondes by Cecil three days before Faukes
  signed it (<i>i.e.</i>, Nov. 14th), the same transposition occurs, Keyes being
  explicitly described as one of those "who wrought not in the mine," although, as we
  have seen, he is one of the three who alone make any mention of it.</p>

  <p>Still more singular is another circumstance. About November 28th, Sir Edward Coke,
  the attorney-general, drew up certain farther notes of questions to be put to various
  prisoners.<sup><a name="FN369A" id="FN369A"></a><a href="#FN369">[369]</a></sup>
  Amongst these we read: "Winter to be examined of his brother. For no man else can
  accuse him." But a fortnight or so before this time the Secretary of State had
  officially informed the ambassador in the Low Countries that Robert Winter was one of
  those deepest in the treason, and, to say nothing of other evidence, a proclamation for
  his apprehension had been issued on November 18th. Yet Coke's interrogatory seems to
  imply that nothing had yet been established against him, and that he was not known to
  the general body of the traitors as a fellow-conspirator.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

  <h4>v. <i>Captain Hugh Owen, Father William Baldwin, and others.</i></h4>

  <p>We have seen something of the extreme anxiety evinced by the English government to
  incriminate a certain Hugh Owen, a Welsh soldier of fortune serving in Flanders under
  the archduke.<sup><a name="FN370A" id="FN370A"></a><a href="#FN370">[370]</a></sup>
  With him were joined Father Baldwin, the Jesuit, and Sir William Stanley, who, like
  Owen, was in the archduke's service. The measures taken in regard of them are
  exceedingly instructive if we would understand upon what sort of evidence the guilt of
  obnoxious individuals was proclaimed as incontrovertible.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

  <p>No time was lost in commencing operations. On November 14th, three days before
  Faukes signed the celebrated declaration which we have examined, and in which Owen was
  not mentioned, the Earl of Salisbury wrote to Edmondes, ambassador at
  Brussels,<sup><a name="FN371A" id="FN371A"></a><a href="#FN371">[371]</a></sup> that
  Faukes had now directly accused Owen, whose extradition must therefore be demanded. In
  proof of this assertion he inclosed a copy of the declaration, in which, however,
  curiously enough, no mention of Owen's name occurs.<sup><a name="FN372A" id=
  "FN372A"></a><a href="#FN372">[372]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Edmondes on his side was equally prompt. He at once laid the matter before the
  archduke and his ministers, and on November 19th was able to write to Salisbury that
  Owen and his secretary were apprehended and their papers and ciphers seized, and that,
  "If there shall fall out matter to charge Owen with partaking in the treason, the
  archduke will not refuse the king to yield him to be answerable to
  justice,"<sup><a name="FN373A" id="FN373A"></a><a href="#FN373">[373]</a></sup> though
  venturing to hope that he would be able to clear himself of so terrible an
  accusation.</p>

  <p>On "the last of November" the subject was pursued in an epistle from the King
  himself to the "Archdukes,"<sup><a name="FN374A" id="FN374A"></a><a href=
  "#FN374">[374]</a></sup> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg
  186]</a></span>in which the undoubted guilt of both Owen and Baldwin was roundly
  affirmed.<sup><a name="FN375A" id="FN375A"></a><a href="#FN375">[375]</a></sup></p>

  <p>On December 2nd, 1605, Salisbury wrote to Edmondes:<sup><a name="FN376A" id=
  "FN376A"></a><a href="#FN376">[376]</a></sup> "I do warrant you to deliver upon the
  forfeiture of my judgment in your opinion that it shall appear as evident as the sun in
  the clearest day, that Baldwin by means of Owen, and Owen directly by himself, have
  been particular conspirators."</p>

  <p>In spite of this, the authorities in Flanders asked for proofs of the guilt of those
  whom they were asked to give up. Wherefore Edmondes wrote (December 27th) to secure the
  co-operation of Cornwallis, his fellow-ambassador, at Madrid. After declaring that Owen
  and Baldwin were now found to have been "principal dealers in the late execrable
  treason," with remarkable <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> he thus continues:<sup><a name=
  "FN377A" id="FN377A"></a><a href="#FN377">[377]</a></sup></p>

  <p>"I will not conceal from your lordship that they have been here so unrespective as
  to desire for their better satisfaction to have a copy of the information against the
  said persons to be sent over hither; which I fear will be very displeasing to his
  Majesty to understand."</p>

  <p>In January (1605-6), Salisbury sending, in the King's name, instructions to Sir E.
  Coke as to the trial of the conspirators, concluded with this admonition:<sup><a name=
  "FN378A" id="FN378A"></a><a href="#FN378">[378]</a></sup> "You must remember to lay
  Owen as foul in this as you <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg
  187]</a></span>can," which certainly does not suggest that the case against him was
  overwhelmingly strong.</p>

  <p>After the execution of the traitors, an Act of Attainder passed by Parliament
  included Owen amongst them.<sup><a name="FN379A" id="FN379A"></a><a href=
  "#FN379">[379]</a></sup></p>

  <p>The archdukes remaining unconvinced, another and very notable argument was brought
  into play. On February 12th, 1605-6, Salisbury wrote to Edmondes:<sup><a name="FN380A"
  id="FN380A"></a><a href="#FN380">[380]</a></sup></p>

  <p>"As for the particular depositions against Owen and Baldwin, which the archdukes
  desire to have a sight of, you may let them know that it is a matter which can make but
  little to the purpose, considering that his Majesty already upon his royal word hath
  certified the archdukes of their guilt."</p>

  <p>As to Owen's own papers which had been seized, the archduke assured the English
  ambassador,<sup><a name="FN381A" id="FN381A"></a><a href="#FN381">[381]</a></sup> "that
  if there had been anything to have been discovered out of the said papers touching the
  late treason (as he was well assured of the contrary), he would not have failed to have
  imparted the same to his Majesty."</p>

  <p>At a later date the Spanish minister De Grenada wrote from Valladolid<sup><a name=
  "FN382A" id="FN382A"></a><a href="#FN382">[382]</a></sup> that men could not be
  delivered <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>up
  on mere suspicion, which might prove groundless, but that the archduke had received
  orders to sift the matter to the bottom, in order that justice might be done "very
  fully."</p>

  <p>About the same time President Richardot informed Edmondes<sup><a name="FN383A" id=
  "FN383A"></a><a href="#FN383">[383]</a></sup> that Owen strenuously denied the charges
  against him, "and that there is the more probability of his innocency for that his
  papers having been carefully visited, there doth not appear anything in them to charge
  him concerning the said matter."</p>

  <p>On April 21st Salisbury informed Edmondes of a conference on the subject between the
  king and the archduke's ambassador.<sup><a name="FN384A" id="FN384A"></a><a href=
  "#FN384">[384]</a></sup> The latter declared that his master was ready to prosecute the
  accused in his own courts if evidence was furnished him, but in reply King James
  explained that this was impossible, and that he "was loth to send any papers or
  accusations over, not knowing how they might be framed or construed there by the
  formalities of their laws." He added that it was useless now to talk of evidence,
  "seeing the wretch is already condemned by the public sentence of the whole Parliament,
  which sentence the archdukes might see if they would." The ambassador thereupon asked
  to have a copy, but was curtly told that it would presently be printed, when he could
  buy one for twelve pence and send it to his masters, but that the king was not disposed
  to make a present of it.</p>

  <p>In these circumstances the archdukes determined to detain Owen no longer, and he was
  presently discharged. The news of this proceeding produced a <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>remarkable change in the
  tone of his accusers. On June 18th, the secretary wrote to Edmondes<sup><a name=
  "FN385A" id="FN385A"></a><a href="#FN385">[385]</a></sup> that Owen's enlargement
  "seemed to give too much credit to his innocency;" moreover, that "though his Majesty
  showed no great disposition (for many considerations specified unto you) to send over
  the papers and accusations against him, ... yet this proceeded not out of any
  conscience of the invalidity of the proofs, but rather in respect that his process
  being made here, and the caitiff condemned by the public sentence of the Parliament, it
  would have come all to one issue, seeing they have proceeded when his Majesty left it
  to themselves to do as they thought fit."</p>

  <p>To reinforce this lucid explanation Salisbury sent six days later what had before
  been refused, an abstract of "confessions against Owen," and a corrected copy of the
  Act of Attainder. These documents deserve some consideration.</p>

  <p>We have seen how much stress was laid upon the action of Parliament in regard of
  Owen, although the Act of Attainder which it passed affords no information whatever to
  assist our judgment of his case. In moving for this attainder, Sir E. Coke appeared at
  the bar of the House of Commons (April 29th, 1606) to exhibit the evidence on which the
  charge rested. His notes of this evidence, which are extant,<sup><a name="FN386A" id=
  "FN386A"></a><a href="#FN386">[386]</a></sup> clearly show that the government
  possessed no proofs at all beyond surmise and inference.<sup><a name="FN387A" id=
  "FN387A"></a><a href="#FN387">[387]</a></sup> Three testimonies were cited <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>which were quite
  inconsistent and mutually destructive: (1) An extract from a confession of Guy Faukes,
  January 20th, 1605-6, declaring that he had himself initiated Owen in the Plot in May,
  1605. (2) An information of one Ralph Ratcliffe, to the effect that Owen and Baldwin
  were busy with the Plot in April, 1604. (3) T. Winter's testimony&mdash;from his famous
  confession of November 23rd, or 25th, 1605&mdash;that in the spring of 1604 Owen had
  assisted him to secure the services of Faukes.</p>

  <p>In Salisbury's letter to Edmondes, the first and the last of these alone were
  cited,<sup><a name="FN388A" id="FN388A"></a><a href="#FN388">[388]</a></sup> probably
  because it had by this time been perceived that Ratcliffe's evidence flatly
  contradicted that of Faukes.</p>

  <p>Winter's confession has already been discussed, and moreover affords no proof that
  Owen was acquainted with the purpose for which the services of Faukes were required.
  There remains the very circumstantial story of Faukes himself, which belongs to a
  curious and interesting class of documents, containing matter of the highest
  importance, whereof no trace, not even a copy, is to be found amongst the State Papers.
  These comprise various confessions of Faukes, dated November 19th, 25th, and 30th,
  1605, and January 20th, 1605-6, all dealing with information of a sensational nature,
  concerning which we learn nothing from the eleven depositions of the same conspirator
  preserved in the Record Office.<sup><a name="FN389A" id="FN389A"></a><a href=
  "#FN389">[389]</a></sup> For our knowledge of these <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>mysterious documents we have to depend on
  transcripts of portions of them among the Tanner MSS. in the Bodleian Library, on
  fragmentary Latin versions in the <i>Antilogia</i> of Bishop Abbot, and on the extract
  cited from the last amongst them by Sir Edward Coke, which exactly agrees with that
  sent by Salisbury to Edmondes, as above mentioned.</p>

  <p>It cannot escape notice that although these versions all profess to be taken from
  the originals under Faukes' hand, they are so utterly different as to preclude the
  belief that they have been copied from the same documents.<sup><a name="FN390A" id=
  "FN390A"></a><a href="#FN390">[390]</a></sup></p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

  <p>It must farther be observed that we hear nothing of important matters contained in
  these confessions till the supposed author and his confederates were all dead, whereas
  these are such as would certainly have been <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193"
  id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>produced on their trial had this been
  possible.<sup><a name="FN391A" id="FN391A"></a><a href="#FN391">[391]</a></sup> Some of
  the evidence thus afforded is, in fact, too good, for the Government's purpose, to be
  true, for if authentic, it would have secured results which, though much desired, were
  never obtained. In particular it would have established beyond question the guilt of
  the Jesuits abroad, and especially of Father Baldwin.<sup><a name="FN392A" id=
  "FN392A"></a><a href="#FN392">[392]</a></sup> It is this Father, however, whose case
  conclusively proves the utter worthlessness of the evidence. Having been proclaimed and
  branded by the English government <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id=
  "Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>as a convicted traitor, he, five years later, fell into
  their hands, being delivered up, in 1610, by their ally the Elector Palatine. He was at
  once thrown into the Tower, where he was frequently and rigorously examined, it is said
  even on the rack.<sup><a name="FN393A" id="FN393A"></a><a href="#FN393">[393]</a></sup>
  After a confinement of eight years he was discharged "with honour," his innocence being
  attested by the respect with which he was treated by men of all parties.<sup><a name=
  "FN394A" id="FN394A"></a><a href="#FN394">[394]</a></sup> In view of this
  unquestionable acquittal the famous proofs of his criminality, though certified on the
  royal word of King James himself, forfeit all claim to consideration.</p>

  <p>A word may be added concerning Father Cresswell, an English Jesuit residing in
  Spain. He, too, was assumed to have been deeply implicated in this and other treasons.
  In November, 1605, Cecil included his name in a list of traitors against whom proofs
  were to be procured.<sup><a name="FN395A" id="FN395A"></a><a href=
  "#FN395">[395]</a></sup> It was even asserted that at the time of the intended
  explosion he came over to England "to bear his part with the rest of his Society in a
  victorial song of thanksgiving."<sup><a name="FN396A" id="FN396A"></a><a href=
  "#FN396">[396]</a></sup> He was, moreover, loudly denounced as the principal agent in
  the notorious Spanish Treason.</p>

  <p>After all this it is somewhat surprising to find Sir Charles Cornwallis, the English
  Ambassador, while the excitement of the Powder Plot was at its height, testifying in
  the most cordial terms to his esteem for the said Cresswell. The latter having been
  called to Rome by his superiors, Cornwallis (December <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>23rd, N.S. 1605,) addressed to him the
  following letter.<sup><a name="FN397A" id="FN397A"></a><a href=
  "#FN397">[397]</a></sup></p>

  <p>"Sir, although in matter of religion well you know that there are many discords
  between us, yet sure in your duty and loyalty to my King and Country I find in you so
  good a concordance I cannot but much reverence and love you, and wish you all the
  happiness that a man of your sort upon the earth can desire.</p>

  <p>"Much am I (I assure you) grieved at your departure, and the more that I was put in
  so good hope that your journey should have been stayed. The time of the year unpleasant
  to travel in, your body, as I think, not much accustomed to journeys of so great
  length, and the great good you did here to your poor countrymen (which now they want)
  are great motives to make your friends to wish your will in that voyage had been
  broken.</p>

  <p>"If it be not, I shall not believe in words, for many here do greatly desire you for
  causes spiritual, and some for temporal. In the latter number am I, who, not affecting
  your spiritualities (for that these in you abound to superfluity), do much reverence
  and respect your temporal abilities, as wherein I acknowledge much wisdom, temper, and
  sincerity. So no friends you have shall ever more desire good unto you than myself. And
  therefore I wish I were able to make so good demonstration as willingly I would that I
  ever will here and in all places in this world rest</p>

  <p class="right">"Your very assured loving friend,</p>

  <p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Ch. Co.</span>"</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

  <p>About the same time, in an undated letter to Lord Salisbury,<sup><a name="FN398A"
  id="FN398A"></a><a href="#FN398">[398]</a></sup> Cornwallis again expresses his regret
  on account of the removal of Cresswell from Spain.</p>

  <h4>vi. <i>Other Documents.</i></h4>

  <p>It is impossible to analyze in detail the evidence supplied by the several
  conspirators after their capture, or to examine the endless inconsistencies and
  contradictions with which it abounds. One or two points must, however, be
  indicated.</p>

  <p>1. As we have seen, it is clear that at the beginning an effort was made to invest
  the Plot with a far wider political significance than was afterwards attempted, and to
  introduce elements which were soon quietly laid aside. In the interrogatories prepared
  by Sir E. Coke and Chief Justice Popham, we find it suggested that the death of the
  Earl of Salisbury was a main feature of the scheme, "absolutely agreed upon" among the
  conspirators. Also that the titular Earl of Westmoreland, the titular Lord Dacre, the
  Earl of Northumberland, Sir Walter Raleigh, and others were mixed up in the
  business.</p>

  <p>Nor were such endeavours altogether fruitless, for, supposing the testimony extorted
  from the prisoners to be worthy of credit, information was obtained altogether changing
  the character and complexion of the design. This was, however, presently buried in
  oblivion and treated as of no moment whatever.</p>

  <p>Thus in Sir Everard Digby's declaration of Nov. 23rd,<sup><a name="FN399A" id=
  "FN399A"></a><a href="#FN399">[399]</a></sup> we find him testifying that the Earls of
  Westmoreland <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg
  197]</a></span>and Derby,<sup><a name="FN400A" id="FN400A"></a><a href=
  "#FN400">[400]</a></sup> were to have been sent to raise forces in the north. Faukes,
  in the famous confession which we have so fully discussed, was made to say "They meant
  also to have sent for the prisoners in the Tower to have come to them, of whom
  particularly they had some consultation," and although this important clause was
  omitted from the finished version finally adopted, it appears in that of Nov. 14th,
  sent by Cecil to the ambassador at Brussels. Again, in his examination of November 9th,
  famous for the ghastly evidence of torture afforded by his signature, we find Faukes
  declaring, "He confesseth also that there was speech amongst them to draw Sir Walter
  Rawley to take part with them, being one that might stand them in good stead, <i>as
  others in like sort were named</i>."<sup><a name="FN401A" id="FN401A"></a><a href=
  "#FN401">[401]</a></sup></p>

  <p>With regard to Raleigh it must be remembered that he was in a very special manner
  obnoxious to Salisbury, who, however, was at great pains to disguise his hostility. On
  occasion of Sir Walter's trial, in 1603, he vehemently protested that it was a great
  grief to him to have to pronounce against one whom he had hitherto loved.<sup><a name=
  "FN402A" id="FN402A"></a><a href="#FN402">[402]</a></sup> But two years earlier, in his
  secret correspondence with James, he had not only described <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>Raleigh to the future
  king as one of the diabolical triplicity hatching cockatrice eggs, but had solemnly
  protested that if he feigned friendship for such a wretch, it was only with the purpose
  of drawing him on to discover his real nature.<sup><a name="FN403A" id=
  "FN403A"></a><a href="#FN403">[403]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Even more worthy of notice is the shameless manner in which evidence was falsified.
  That produced in court consisted entirely of the written depositions of the prisoners
  themselves, and of those who had been similarly examined. It was, however, carefully
  manipulated before it was read; all that told in favour of those whose conviction was
  desired being omitted, and only so much retained as would tell against them. On this
  subject Mr. Jardine well remarks:<sup><a name="FN404A" id="FN404A"></a><a href=
  "#FN404">[404]</a></sup> "This mode of dealing with the admissions of an accused person
  is pure and unmixed injustice; it is in truth a forgery of evidence; for when a
  qualified statement is made, the suppression of the qualification is no less a forgery
  than if the whole statement had been fabricated."</p>

  <p>It will be sufficient to cite one notorious and compendious <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>example. In regard of the
  oath of secrecy taken by the conspirators, Faukes (Nov. 9th, 1605) and Thomas Winter
  (Jan. 9th, 1605-6) related how they administered it to one another, "in a chamber," to
  quote Winter, "where no other body was," and afterwards proceeded to another chamber
  where they heard Mass and received Communion at the hands of Father
  Gerard.<sup><a name="FN405A" id="FN405A"></a><a href="#FN405">[405]</a></sup> Both
  witnesses, however, emphatically declared that the Father knew nothing of the oath that
  had been taken, or of the purpose of the associates.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

  <div class="figcenter c7">
    <a name="image21" id="image21"></a><img src="images/image21.png" width="600" height=
    "309" alt="FROM FAUKES' CONFESSION OF NOVEMBER 9, 1605." title="" /> <span class=
    "caption"><span class="smcap">from faukes' confession of november 9,
    1605.</span></span>
  </div>

  <p>Such testimony in favour of one whom they were anxious above all things to
  incriminate, the government would not allow to appear. Accordingly, Sir E. Coke,
  preparing the documents to be used in court as evidence, marked off the exculpatory
  passages, with directions that they were not to be read.<sup><a name="FN406A" id=
  "FN406A"></a><a href="#FN406">[406]</a></sup> Having thus suppressed the passage which
  declared that the Jesuit was unaware of the conspirators' purpose, and of their oath,
  Coke went on to inform the jury, in his speech, "This oath was by Gerard the Jesuit
  given to Catesby, Percy, Christopher Wright, and Thomas Winter, and by Greenwell
  [Greenway] the Jesuit to Bates at another time, and so to the rest."<sup><a name=
  "FN407A" id="FN407A"></a><a href="#FN407">[407]</a></sup></p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

  <p>3. Neither must it be forgotten that even apart from these manifest instances of
  tampering, the confessions themselves, obtained in such circumstances, are open to much
  suspicion. In an intercepted letter to Father Baldwin, of whom we have heard, Father
  Schondonck, another Jesuit, then rector of St. Omers, speaks thus:<sup><a name="FN408A"
  id="FN408A"></a><a href="#FN408">[408]</a></sup> "I much rejoice that, as I hear, there
  is no confession produced, by which, either in court or at the place of execution, any
  of our society is accused of so abominable a crime. This I consider a point of prime
  importance. <i>Of secret confessions, or those extorted by violence or torture, less
  account must be made; for we have many examples whereby the dishonesty of our enemies
  in such matters has been fully displayed.</i>"</p>

  <p>Father John Gerard in his Autobiography<sup><a name="FN409A" id=
  "FN409A"></a><a href="#FN409">[409]</a></sup> relates an experience of his own which
  illustrates the methods employed to procure evidence such as was required. <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>When, in Queen
  Elizabeth's time, he had himself been taken and thrown into prison, the notorious
  Topcliffe, the priest-hunter, endeavoured to force him into an acknowledgment of
  various matters of a treasonable character. Father Gerard undertook to write what he
  had to say on the subject, and proceeded to set down an explicit denial of what his
  questioner suggested. What followed he thus relates.<sup><a name="FN410A" id=
  "FN410A"></a><a href="#FN410">[410]</a></sup></p>

  <p>"While I was writing this, the old man waxed wroth. He shook with passion, and would
  fain have snatched the paper from me."</p>

  <p>"'If you don't want me to write the truth,' said I, 'I'll not write at all.'"</p>

  <p>"'Nay,' quoth he, 'write so and so, and I'll copy out what you have written.'"</p>

  <p>"'I shall write what I please,' I answered, 'and not what <i>you</i> please. Show
  what I have written to the Council, for I shall add nothing but my name.'"</p>

  <p>"<i>Then I signed so near the writing, that nothing could be put in between.</i> The
  hot-tempered man, seeing himself disappointed, broke out into threats and blasphemies:
  'I'll get you into my power, and hang you in the air, and show you no mercy: and then I
  shall see what God will rescue you out of my hands.'"</p>

  <p>It was not by Catholics alone that allegations of this sort were advanced. Sir
  Anthony Weldon tells us<sup><a name="FN411A" id="FN411A"></a><a href=
  "#FN411">[411]</a></sup> that on the trial of Raleigh and Cobham, the latter protested
  that he had never made the declaration attributed to him incriminating Raleigh. "That
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>villain
  Wade,"<sup><a name="FN412A" id="FN412A"></a><a href="#FN412">[412]</a></sup> said he,
  "did often solicit me, and, not prevailing, got me, by a trick, to write my name on a
  piece of white paper, which I, thinking nothing, did; so that if any charge came under
  my hand, it was forged by that villain Wade, by writing something above my hand,
  without my consent or knowledge."</p>

  <p>Moreover, there exists undoubted evidence that the king's chief minister availed
  himself upon occasion of the services of such as could counterfeit handwriting and
  forge evidence against suspected persons. One Arthur Gregory<sup><a name="FN413A" id=
  "FN413A"></a><a href="#FN413">[413]</a></sup> appears to have been thus employed, and
  he subsequently wrote to Salisbury reminding him of what he had done.<sup><a name=
  "FN414A" id="FN414A"></a><a href="#FN414">[414]</a></sup> After acknowledging that he
  owes his life to the secretary who knows how to appreciate "an honest desire in respect
  of his Majesty's public service," Gregory thus continues:</p>

  <p>"Your Lordship hath had a present trial of that which none but myself hath done
  before, <i>to write in another man's hand</i>, and, discovering the secret writing
  being in blank, to abuse a most cunning villain in his own subtlety, leaving the same
  at last in blank again, wherein although there be difficulty their answers show they
  have no suspicion."</p>

  <p>This the calendarer of State Papers believes to refer to the case of Father Garnet,
  and it is certain from <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg
  204]</a></span>Gregory's own letter that at one time he held a post in the Tower. Is it
  not possible that an explanation may here be found of the strange circumstance, that
  perhaps the most important of Father Garnet's examinations<sup><a name="FN415A" id=
  "FN415A"></a><a href="#FN415">[415]</a></sup> bears an endorsement, "This was forbydden
  by the King to be given in evidence"?</p>

  <p>Gregory's letter, of which we have been speaking, has appended to it an instructive
  postscript:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lieutenant expecteth something to be written in the blank leaf of a Latin
  Bible, which is pasted in already for the purpose. I will attend it, and whatsoever
  else cometh."<sup><a name="FN416A" id="FN416A"></a><a href="#FN416">[416]</a></sup></p>

  <h4>vii. <i>Catholic Testimony.</i></h4>

  <p>It will not improbably be urged that the government history is confirmed in all
  essential particulars by authorities to whom no exception can be taken, namely,
  contemporary Catholic writers, and especially the Jesuits Gerard and Greenway, whose
  narratives of the conspiracy corroborate every detail concerning which doubts have been
  insinuated.</p>

  <p>This argument is undoubtedly deserving of all consideration, but upon examination
  appears to lose much of its force. If the narratives in question agree with that
  furnished by the government, it is because they are based almost entirely upon it, and
  upon those published confessions of Winter and Faukes with which we are familiar.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

  <p>On this point Father Gerard is very explicit:<sup><a name="FN417A" id=
  "FN417A"></a><a href="#FN417">[417]</a></sup> "Out of [Mr. Thomas Winter's]
  examination, with the others that were made in the time of their imprisonment, I must
  gather and set down all that is to be said or collected of their purposes and
  proceedings in this heady enterprize. For that, as I have said, they kept it so wholly
  secret from all men, that until their flight and apprehension it was not known to any
  that such a matter was in hand, and then there could none have access to them to learn
  the particulars. But we must be contented with that which some of those that lived to
  be examined, did therein deliver. Only for that some of their servants that were up in
  arms with them in the country did afterwards escape, somewhat might be learned by them
  of their carriage in their last extremities, and some such words as they then uttered,
  whereby their mind in the whole matter is something the more opened."</p>

  <p>Elsewhere he writes, exhibiting more confidence in government documents than we can
  feel:<sup><a name="FN418A" id="FN418A"></a><a href="#FN418">[418]</a></sup></p>

  <p>"[The prisoners'] examinations did all agree in all material points, and therefore
  two only were published in print, containing the substance of the rest. And indeed
  [this is] the sum of that which I have been able to say in this narration touching
  either their first intentions or the names or number of the conspirators, or concerning
  the course they took to keep the matter so absolutely secret, or, finally, touching the
  manner of their beginning and proceeding in the whole matter; for that&mdash;as I noted
  before&mdash;it being kept a vowed secret in the heads and hearts of so few, and those
  also <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg
  206]</a></span>afterwards apprehended before they could have means to declare the
  particulars in any private manner, therefore no more can be known of the matter or
  manner of this tragedy than is found or gathered out of their examinations."</p>

  <p>As for Greenway, it should not be forgotten that for the most part he confined
  himself to translating Gerard's narrative from English into Italian, though he
  supplemented it occasionally with items furnished by his own experience as to the
  character and general conduct of the conspirators on previous occasions, or during
  their last desperate rally. Of this he was able to speak with more authority, as he not
  only chanced to be in the immediate neighbourhood, but actually visited them at
  Huddington House (the seat of Robert Winter) on November 6th, being summoned thither by
  Catesby through his servant Bates.<sup><a name="FN419A" id="FN419A"></a><a href=
  "#FN419">[419]</a></sup> Greenway, like Gerard, constantly refers to the published
  confessions of Winter and Faukes as the sources of his information.</p>

  <p>It may here be observed that the practical identity <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>of the narratives of these two fathers was
  unknown to Mr. Jardine, who having seen only that of Father Greenway, and believing it
  to be an original work, founded upon this erroneous assumption an argument which loses
  its force when we learn the real author to have been Gerard. Mr. Jardine maintains that
  the narrator must, from internal evidence, have been an active and zealous member of
  the conspiracy, "approving, promoting and encouraging it with the utmost
  enthusiasm."<sup><a name="FN420A" id="FN420A"></a><a href="#FN420">[420]</a></sup> It
  so happens, however, that the real author, Father Gerard, is just the one of the
  incriminated Jesuits whose innocence is held by historians certainly not partial to his
  Order, to be beyond question. Mr. Gardiner considers<sup><a name="FN421A" id=
  "FN421A"></a><a href="#FN421">[421]</a></sup> that there is "strong reason" to believe
  him not to have been acquainted with the Plot. Dr. Jessopp is still more emphatic, and
  declares<sup><a name="FN422A" id="FN422A"></a><a href="#FN422">[422]</a></sup>
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>that it is
  impossible for any candid reader of all the evidence to doubt that Gerard must be
  exonerated.</p>

  <p>What has been said of Gerard and Greenway may serve also for Father Garnet, who in
  his various examinations and other utterances assumes the truth of the government
  story, for neither had he materials to go upon except those officially supplied.</p>
  <hr class='c14' />

  <p>It is obvious that the conclusion to be drawn from the above considerations is
  chiefly negative. That the conspirators embarked on a plot against the state, is, of
  course unquestionable. What was the precise nature of that plot is by no means clear,
  and still less what were the exact circumstances of its initiation and its collapse.
  This only appears to be certain, that things did not happen as they were officially
  related, while the elaborate care expended on the falsification of the story seems to
  indicate that the true version would not have served the purposes to which that story
  was actually put.</p>

    The contemporary, Hawarde (<i>Les Reportes del Cases in Camera Stellata</i>) gives a
    report of the trial of the conspirators, under the curious title "<i>Al le
    arraignemente del Traitors por le grande treason of blowinge up the Parliamente
    Howse</i>," which, although evidently based upon the official account, differs in two
    remarkable particulars. In the first place it gives a different list of the
    commissioners by whom the trial was conducted, omitting Justice Warburton, and
    including instead, Lord Chief Baron Flemming, Justices Yelverton and Williams, and
    Baron Saville. Moreover, Hawarde says that the king and queen "were both there in
    pryvate," an important circumstance, of which the <i>True and Perfect Relation</i>
    says nothing.</p>

    Father Garnet clearly believed that this advantage was used unscrupulously against
    him, for when certain evidence attributed to Bates was cited, he replied that "Bates
    was a dead man," and would testify otherwise if he were alive. (Brit. Mus. MSS. Add.
    21203. <i>Foley's Records</i>, iv. p. 188.)</p>

    It is frequently said that the search at Hendlip was undertaken not for Garnet but
    for Oldcorne, whose presence there was known by the confession of Humphrey Littleton.
    But this confession was made several days after the search had been begun, and the
    directions for it given by Cecil to the sheriff, Sir H. Bromley, clearly indicate
    that he had in view some capture of prime importance. (See Gardiner's <i>History</i>,
    i. 271, and Brit. Mus. MSS. Add. 6178, f. 693.)</p>

    <p>The Lord Admiral was the Earl of Nottingham, better known as Lord Howard of
    Effingham, the commander-in-chief against the Spanish Armada. There appears to be no
    foundation for the supposition that he was a Catholic. Northampton (Henry Howard) was
    a professing Catholic. The chamberlain was the Earl of Suffolk, the Chief Justice,
    Popham.</p>

    The <i>Calendar of State Papers</i> assigns this document, like the other, to the

    Thus the <i>examination</i> of November 8th begins as follows: "He confesseth that a
    Practise in generall was first broken unto him, agaynst his Majesty, for the
    Catholique cause, and not invented, or propounded by himself: and this was first
    propounded unto him, about Easter last was twelvemonth, beyond the seas, in the Low
    Countreyes, by an English Lay-man, and that English man came over with him in his
    company, into England, and they tow and three more were the first five, mencioned in
    the former examination," etc.</p>

    <p>The <i>declaration</i> of November 17th opens: "I confesse that a practise in
    general was first broken unto me against his Majesty, for releife of the Catholique
    cause, and not invented or propounded by myself. And this was first propounded unto
    me about Easter last was twelvemonth, beyond the Seas, in the Low Countries of the

    Thus, in the confession of November 8th, we read as follows: "He confesseth, that it
    was resolved amonge them, that the same day that this detestable act should have been
    performed, the same day [<i>sic</i>] should other of their confederacye have
    surprised the person of the Lady Elizabeth and presently have proclaimed her queen
    [to which purpose a Proclamation was drawne, as well to avow and justifye the Action,
    as to have protested against the Union, and in noe sort to have meddled with Religion
    therein. And would have protested all soe against all strangers,] and this
    Proclamation should have been made in the name of the Lady Elizabeth."</p>

    <p>The portion within brackets is cancelled, and the following substituted: "He
    confesseth that if their purpose had taken effect, untill they had power enough, they
    would not have avowed the deed to be theirs; but if their power ... had been
    sufficient, they thereafter would have taken it upon them."</p>

    <p>The corresponding portion of the declaration of November 17th runs thus: "It was
    further resolved amongst us, that the same day that this action should have been
    performed, some other of our confederates should have surprised the person of the L.
    Elizabeth, the King's eldest daughter, ... and presently proclaimed her for Queene,
    having a <i>project</i> of a Proclamation ready for the purpose, wherein we made no
    mention of altering of Religion, nor would have avowed the deed to be ours, untill we

    In the <i>Calendar of State Papers</i>, Mrs. Everett Green, as has been said, quite
    gratuitously and without warrant from the original documents, uniformly describes him
    as "Father Owen," or "Owen the Jesuit." Mr. Gardiner (<i>Hist.</i> i. 242) has been
    led into the same error.</p>

    <p>It is not impossible that Owen had some knowledge of the conspiracy, though the
    course adopted by his enemies seems to afford strong presumption to the contrary. It
    must, moreover, be remembered that, as Father Gerard tells us, he and others
    similarly accused, vehemently protested against the imputation, while in his case in
    particular we have some evidence to the same effect. Thomas Phelippes, the
    "Decipherer," of whom we have already heard, was on terms of close intimacy with
    Owen, and in December, 1605, wrote to him about the Plot in terms which certainly
    appear to imply a strong conviction that his friend had nothing to do with it.</p>

    <p>"There hath been and yet is still great paynes taken to search to the bottom of
    the late damnable conspiracy. The Parliamente hit seemes shall not be troubled with
    any extraordinarie course for their exemplarye punishment, as was supposed upon the

    This is obvious from a marginal note in Coke's own hand, arguing that Owen must be

    <p class="ni"><sup><a name="FN390" id="FN390"></a><a href="#FN390A">[390]</a></sup>
    Thus, to confine ourselves to the confession of January 20th, with which we are
    particularly concerned, we have the following variations:</p>

    <p><i>Tanner transcript.</i> "At my going over M<sup>r</sup> Catesby charged me two
    things more: the one to desire of Baldwin &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Owen to deal with the
    Marquis [Spinola] to send over the regiment of which he [Catesby] expected to have
    been Lieutenant Colonel under Sir Charles [Percy].... He wished me secondly to be
    earnest with Baldwin to deal with the Marquis to give the said M<sup>r</sup> Catesby
    order for a Company of Horse, thinking by that means to have opportunity to buy
    Horses and Arms without suspition."</p>

    <p>According to <i>Abbot</i>, Faukes was to give instructions that when the time of
    Parliament approached, Sir Wm. Stanley was on some pretext to lead the English forces
    in the archduke's service towards the sea, and with them any others he could manage
    to influence. He also mentions the conspiracy of Morgan, as spoken of by Coke.</p>

    <p>In addition to all this, Abbot cites from the same confession the following
    extraordinary particulars (p. 160): Faukes, when he came to London, with T. Winter,
    went to Percy's house and found there Catesby and Father Gerard. They talked over
    matters, and agreed that nothing was to be hoped from foreign aid, nor from a general
    rising of Catholics, and that the only plan was to strike at the king's person:
    whereupon Catesby, Percy, John Wright, Winter, and himself, were sworn in by
    Gerard.</p>

    <p>[This is in absolute contradiction to Winter's evidence (November 23rd) that Percy
    was initiated in the middle of the Easter term, the other four having agreed on the
    scheme at the beginning of the same term; and to that of Faukes himself (November
    17th) that he and Winter first resolved on a plot for the benefit of the Catholic
    cause, and afterwards imparted their idea to Catesby, Wright, and Percy.]</p>

    <p><i>Sir E. Coke's Version.</i> "After the powder treason was resolved upon by
    Catesbye, Thomas Winter, the Wrightes, my self, and others, and preparation made by
    us for the execution of it, by their advise and direction I went into fflanders and
    had leave given unto me to discover our project in every particular to Hughe Owen and
    others, but with condicion that they should sweare first to secrecie as we our selves
    had done. When I arryved in fflanders I found M<sup>r</sup> Owen at Bruxelles to whom
    after I had given the oathe of secrecye I discovered the whole busines, howe we had
    layed 20 whole barrells of powder in the celler under the parliament howse, and howe
    we ment to give it fire the first day of the parliament when the King, the prince,
    the duke, the Lords spirituall and temporall, and all the knights, citizens, and
    burgesses of parliament should be there assembled. And that we meant to take the
    Ladye Elizabeth and proclaime hir for we thought most like that the prince and duke
    would be there with the king. M<sup>r</sup> Owen liked the plott very well, and said
    that Thomas Morgan had once propounded the very same in quene Elizabeth's time, and
    willed me that by ani meanes we should not make any mencion of religion at the first,
    and assured me that so soone as he should have certaine newes that this exploit had
    taken effect that he would give us what assistance he could and that he would procure
    that Sir W<sup>m</sup> Stanley should have leave to come with those English men which
    be there and what other forces he could procure."</p>

    <p>The confession of Faukes in the Record Office, dated the same, January 20th, is
    thus summarized in the <i>Calendar of State Papers</i> (<i>Dom. James I.</i> xviii.

    he said Lord Mordaunt would not be there, because he did not like to absent himself
    from the sermons, as the king did not know he was a Catholic; and that Lord Stourton
    would not come to town till the Friday after the opening."</p>

    Though we have not now to consider the question of Father Greenway's connection with

    <p>"Father Oswald [Greenway] went to assist these gentlemen with the Sacraments of
    the Church, understanding their danger and their need, and this with evident danger
    to his own person and life: and all those gentlemen could have borne witness that he
    publicly told them how he grieved not so much because of their wretched and shameful
    plight, and the extremity of their peril, as that by their headlong course they had
    given the heretics occasion to slander the whole body of Catholics in the kingdom,
    and that he flatly refused to stay in their company, lest the heretics should be able
    to calumniate himself and the other Fathers of the Society."</p>

    <p class="ni"><sup><a name="FN420" id="FN420"></a><a href="#FN420A">[420]</a></sup>
    In this, as in some other respects, Mr. Jardine shows himself rather an advocate than
    an impartial historian. He holds that the complicity of the writer of the
    <i>Narrative</i> with the plotters is proved by the intimate knowledge he displays
    concerning them, "their general conduct&mdash;their superstitious fears&mdash;their
    dreams&mdash;'their thick coming fancies'&mdash;in the progress of the work of
    destruction." (<i>Criminal Trials</i>, ii. xi.)</p>

    <p>There is here an evident allusion to the silly story of the "bell in the wall"
    (related by Greenway and not by Gerard), to which Mr. Jardine gives extraordinary
    prominence. He does not, however, inform us that Greenway relates this
    (<i>Narrative</i>, f. 58 b) and some similar matters, on the authority of "an
    acquaintance to whom Catesby told it shortly before his death," and that he leaves it
    to the judgment of his readers.</p>

    <p>Greenway's frequent and earnest protestations of innocence Mr. Jardine summarily
    dismisses with the observation that they are "entitled to no credit whatever" (p.
    xii).</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

  <h3>THE SEQUEL.</h3>

  <p class="ni"><span class="smcap">As</span> we have already seen, the Gunpowder Plot
  formed no exception to the general law observable in conspiracies of its period,
  proving extremely advantageous to those against whom it was principally directed. No
  single individual was injured by it except those concerned in it, or accused of being
  so concerned. On the other hand, it marked an epoch in public policy, and irrevocably
  committed the king and the nation to a line of action towards Catholics, which up to
  that time they had hoped, and their enemies had feared, would not be permanently
  pursued.</p>

  <p>"The political consequences of this transaction," says Mr. Jardine,<sup><a name=
  "FN423A" id="FN423A"></a><a href="#FN423">[423]</a></sup> "are extremely important and
  interesting. It fixed the timid and wavering mind of the king in his adherence to the
  Protestant party, in opposition to the Roman Catholics; and the universal horror, which
  was naturally excited not only in England but throughout Europe by so barbarous an
  attempt, was artfully converted into an engine for the suppression of the Roman
  Catholic Church: so that the ministers of James I., having procured the reluctant
  acquiescence of the king, and the cordial assent of public opinion, were enabled to
  continue in full force <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg
  210]</a></span>the severe laws previously passed against Papists, and to enact others
  of no less rigour and injustice."</p>

  <p>Such was the effect in fact produced, and the calm deliberation displayed in dealing
  with the crisis appears to indicate that no misgivings were entertained as to the
  chance of anything but advantage resulting from it. We have already seen with what
  strange equanimity the presence of the powder beneath the Parliament House was treated.
  Not less serene was the attitude of the minister chiefly responsible for the safety of
  the State in face of the grave dangers still declared to be threatening, even after the
  "discovery." Preparations, it was officially announced, had been made for an extensive
  rising of the Catholics, and this had still to be reckoned with. As the king himself
  informed Sir John Harington, the design was not formed by a few, the "whole legion of
  Catholics" were implicated: the priests had been active in preaching the holy war, and
  the Pope himself had employed his authority on behalf of the cause.<sup><a name=
  "FN424A" id="FN424A"></a><a href="#FN424">[424]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Moreover, the conspirators, except Faukes, escaped from London, and hurried to the
  intended scene of action, where, though no man voluntarily joined them, they were able
  at first to collect a certain force of their own retainers and domestics, and began to
  traverse the shires in which their influence was greatest, committing acts of plunder
  and violence, and calling on all men to join them for God and the country. For a couple
  of days the local magistrates did not feel strong enough to cope with them, and
  forwarded to the capital reports capable, it might be <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>supposed, of alarming those who were
  bewildered by so totally unexpected an assault, for which the evidence in hand showed
  preparations of no ordinary magnitude to have been made. The numbers of the insurgents,
  it was said, were constantly increasing; only a feeble force could be brought against
  them; they were seizing horses and ammunition, and all this in "a very Catholic
  country."</p>

  <p>In his famous speech to Parliament, delivered on November 9th, the king dwelt
  feelingly on the danger of the land, left exposed to the traitors, in the absence of
  the members of the legislature, its natural guardians. "These rebels," he
  declared,<sup><a name="FN425A" id="FN425A"></a><a href="#FN425">[425]</a></sup> "that
  now wander through the country could never have gotten so fit a time of safety in their
  passage, or whatsoever unlawful actions, as now; when the country, by the aforesaid
  occasions, is, in a manner, left desolate and waste unto them."<sup><a name="FN426A"
  id="FN426A"></a><a href="#FN426">[426]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Meanwhile, however, the secretary remained imperturbably tranquil as before, and so
  well aware of the true state of the case that he could afford to make merry over the
  madcap adventurers. On the same 9th of November he wrote to the ambassadors: "It is
  also thought fit that some martial men should presently repair down to those countries
  where the Robin Hoods are assembled, to encourage the good and to terrify the bad. In
  which service the Earl of Devonshire <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id=
  "Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>is used, a commission going forth for him as general:
  although I am easily persuaded that this Faggot will be burnt to ashes before he shall
  be twenty miles on his way."</p>

  <p>His prescience was not at fault, for before despatching the letter the minister was
  able to announce the utter collapse of the foolish and unsupported enterprise.</p>

  <p>No time was lost in turning the defeated conspiracy to practical account. On the
  very 5th of November<sup><a name="FN427A" id="FN427A"></a><a href=
  "#FN427">[427]</a></sup> itself the Commons proceeded, before all other business, to
  the first reading of a bill for the better execution of penal statutes against
  Recusants. On the following day this was read a second time. The house next met on the
  9th, to hear the king's speech, and was then prorogued to January 21st following. On
  that day, the foremost article on the programme was the first reading of a bill
  (whether the same or another) for the better execution of penal statutes; another was
  likewise proposed for prevention of the danger of papistical practices; and a committee
  was appointed "to consider of some course for the timely and severe proceeding against
  Jesuits, Seminaries, and other popish agents and practisers, and for the prevention and
  suppression of their plots and practices."<sup><a name="FN428A" id=
  "FN428A"></a><a href="#FN428">[428]</a></sup> On the 22nd there was a motion directed
  against the seminaries beyond the seas, and the bill for better execution of penal
  statutes was read a second time. On the 23rd the bill for a public thanksgiving was
  read twice, being finally <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg
  213]</a></span>passed on the 25th. Its preamble runs thus: "Forasmuch as ... no nation
  of the earth hath been blessed with greater benefits than this kingdom now enjoyeth,
  having the true and free profession of the gospel under our most gracious sovereign
  lord King James, the most great, learned, and religious king that ever reigned therein
  ... the which many malignant and devilish papists, Jesuits, and seminary priests, much
  envying and fearing, conspired most horribly ..." and so forth.</p>

  <p>Thus did the Commons set to work, and the other House, though they declined to
  sanction all that was proposed in the way of exceptional severity towards the actual
  conspirators, were no wise lacking in zeal against the Catholic body.</p>

  <p>The course of legislation that ensued is thus described by Birch:<sup><a name=
  "FN429A" id="FN429A"></a><a href="#FN429">[429]</a></sup></p>

  <p>"The discovery of the Plot occasioned the Parliament to enjoin the oath of
  allegiance to the king, and to enact several laws against Popery, and especially
  against the Jesuits and Priests who, as the Earl of Salisbury observed,<sup><a name=
  "FN430A" id="FN430A"></a><a href="#FN430">[430]</a></sup> sought to bring all things
  into <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg
  214]</a></span>confusion.... In passing these laws for the security of the Protestant
  religion, the Earl of Salisbury exerted himself with distinguished zeal and vigour,
  which gained him great love and honour from the kingdom, as appeared, in some measure,
  in the unusual attendance upon him at his installation into the Order of the Garter, on
  the 20th of May, 1606,<sup><a name="FN431A" id="FN431A"></a><a href=
  "#FN431">[431]</a></sup> at Windsor."</p>

  <p>It is, indeed, abundantly clear that beyond all others this statesman benefited by
  the Plot, in consequence of which he obtained, at least for a time, a high degree of
  both power and popularity. His installation at Windsor, above mentioned, was an almost
  regal triumph. Baker notes<sup><a name="FN432A" id="FN432A"></a><a href=
  "#FN432">[432]</a></sup> that he was attended on the occasion "beyond ordinary
  promotion." Howes writes<sup><a name="FN433A" id="FN433A"></a><a href=
  "#FN433">[433]</a></sup> that he "set forward from his house in the Strand, being
  almost as honourably accompanied, and with as great a train of lords, knights,
  gentlemen, and officers of the Court, with others besides his peculiar servants, very
  richly attired and bravely mounted, as was the King when he rid in state through
  London."</p>

  <p>Neither were there wanting to the secretary other advantages which, if less showy,
  were not less substantial. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg
  215]</a></span>It will be remembered how, in his secret correspondence with the King of
  Scots before the death of Elizabeth, Cecil had constantly endeavoured to turn the mind
  of his future sovereign against the Earl of Northumberland, whom he declared to be
  associated with Raleigh and Cobham in a "diabolical triplicity," and to be "a sworn
  enemy of King James."<sup><a name="FN434A" id="FN434A"></a><a href=
  "#FN434">[434]</a></sup> These <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id=
  "Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>efforts had not been altogether successful, and though
  Cobham and Raleigh had been effectually disposed of in connection with the conspiracy
  known as the "Main," Northumberland was still powerful, and was thought by many to be
  Cecil's most formidable rival. As one result of the Gunpowder Plot, he now disappeared
  for ever from public life.</p>

  <div class="figcenter c7">
    <a name="image22" id="image22"></a><img src="images/image22.png" width="600" height=
    "566" alt="THE POWDER PLOT. III." title="" /> <span class="caption"><span class=
    "smcap">the powder plot. iii.</span></span>
  </div>

  <p>When we remember the terms in which the secretary had previously described him, as
  well as the result about to ensue, it is not a little startling to remark with what
  emphasis it was protested, in season and out, that a ruling principle of the
  government's action was to do nothing which might even seem to cast a slur upon the
  earl's character, while at the same time the very point is artfully insinuated which
  was to be turned against him.<sup><a name="FN435A" id="FN435A"></a><a href=
  "#FN435">[435]</a></sup> Thus in the "King's Book," in explanation of the curious
  roundabout courses adopted in connection with the "discovery," we are told that a
  far-fetched excuse was devised for the search determined upon, lest it might "lay an
  ill-favoured imputation upon the Earl of Northumberland, one of his Majesty's greatest
  subjects and counsellors; this Thomas Percy being his kinsman and most confident
  familiar." So again Cecil wrote to the ambassadors: "It hath been thought meet in
  policy of State (all circumstances considered) to commit the Earl of Northumberland
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>to the
  Archbishop of Canterbury, there to be honourably used, until things be more quiet.
  Whereof if you shall hear any judgment made, as if his Majesty or his council could
  harbour a thought of such a savage practice to be lodged in such a nobleman's breast,
  you shall do well to suppress it as a malicious discourse and invention, this being
  only done to satisfy the world that nothing be undone which belongs to policy of State,
  when the whole monarchy was proscribed to dissolution; and being no more than himself
  discreetly approved when he received the sentence of the council for his
  restraint."</p>

  <p>Yet what was the issue? A series of charges were brought against Northumberland, all
  of which broke down except that of having, as Captain of the Royal Pensioners, admitted
  Percy amongst them without exacting the usual oath. He in vain demanded an open trial,
  and was brought before the Star Chamber, by which, after he had been assailed by Coke
  in the same violent strain previously employed against Raleigh, he was sentenced to
  forfeit all offices which he held under the Crown, to be imprisoned during the king's
  pleasure, and to pay a fine of &pound;30,000, equal to at least ten times that sum at
  the present day.</p>

  <p>As if this were not enough, fresh proceedings were taken against him six years
  later, when he was again subjected to examination, and again, says
  Lingard,<sup><a name="FN436A" id="FN436A"></a><a href="#FN436">[436]</a></sup> foiled
  the ingenuity or malice of his persecutor.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

  <p>It seems, therefore, by no means extraordinary that men, as we have heard from the
  French ambassador, should have commonly attributed the earl's ruin to the resolution of
  his great rival to remove from his own path every obstacle likely to be dangerous, or
  that Cecil should himself bear witness,<sup><a name="FN437A" id="FN437A"></a><a href=
  "#FN437">[437]</a></sup> in 1611, to the "bruites" touching Northumberland which were
  afloat, and should be anxious, as "knowing how various a discourse a subject of this
  nature doth beget," to "prevent any erroneous impression by a brief narrative of the
  true motive and progress of the business."</p>

  <p>As to Northumberland's own sentiments, he, we are told by Osborne,<sup><a name=
  "FN438A" id="FN438A"></a><a href="#FN438">[438]</a></sup> declared that the blood of
  Percy would refuse to mix with that of Cecil if they were poured together in the same
  basin.</p>

  <p>It is, moreover, evident not only that the great statesman, to use Bishop Goodman's
  term, actually profited largely by the powder business, but that from the first he saw
  in it a means for materially strengthening his position; an opportunity which he lost
  no time in turning to account by making it appear that in such a crisis he was
  absolutely necessary to the State. This is shown by the remarkable manifesto which he
  promptly issued, a document which appears to have been almost forgotten, though well
  deserving attention.</p>

  <p>A characteristic feature of the traitorous proceedings of the period was the
  inveterate habit of conspirators to drop compromising documents in the street, or to
  throw <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>them
  into yards and windows. In the court of Salisbury House was found, in November, 1605, a
  threatening letter, more than usually extraordinary. It purported to come from five
  Catholics, who began by unreservedly condemning the Gunpowder Plot as a work abhorred
  by their co-religionists as much as by any Protestants. Since, however, his lordship,
  beyond all others, seemed disposed to take advantage of so foul a scandal, in order to
  root out all memory of the Catholic religion, they proceeded to warn him that they had
  themselves vowed his death, and in such fashion that their success was certain. None of
  the accomplices knew who the others were, but it was settled who should first make the
  attempt, and who, in order, afterwards. Moreover, death had no terrors for any of them,
  two being stricken with mortal sickness, which must soon be fatal; while the other
  three were in such mental affliction as not to care what became of them.</p>

  <p>As a reply to this strange effusion Cecil published a tract,<sup><a name="FN439A"
  id="FN439A"></a><a href="#FN439">[439]</a></sup> obviously intended as a companion to
  the famous "King's Book," in which with elaborate modesty he owned to the impeachment
  of being more zealous than others in the good cause, and protested his resolution, at
  whatever peril to himself, to continue his services to <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>his king and country. The sum and substance
  of this curious apology is as follows.</p>

  <p>Having resolved to recall his thoughts from the earthly theatre to higher things,
  which statesmen are supposed overmuch to neglect, he had felt he could choose no better
  theme for his meditations than the "King's Book," wherein so many lively images of
  God's great favour and providence are represented, every line discovering where
  Apelles' hand hath been; so that all may see there needs now no Elisha to tell the King
  of Israel what the Aramites do in their privatest councils.</p>

  <p>While in this most serious and silent meditation, divided between rapture at God's
  infinite mercy and justice, and thought of his own happiness to live under a king
  pleasing to God for his zealous endeavours to cleanse the vessels of his kingdom from
  the dregs and lees of the Romish grape,&mdash;and while his heart was not a little
  cheered to observe any note of his own name in the royal register, for one that had
  been of any little use in this so fortunate discovery,&mdash;as the poor day labourer
  who taketh contentment when he passeth that glorious architecture, to the building
  whereof he can remember to have carried some few sticks and stones,&mdash;while thus
  blissfully engaged, he is grieved to find himself singled out from the honourable body
  of the council,&mdash;why, he knows not, for with it he would be content to be
  identified&mdash;as the author of the policy which is being adopted; and, conscious
  that in his humble person the Body of Authority is assailed, he thinks it well, for
  once, to make a reply.</p>

  <p>Having recited the threatening letter in full, he presently continues:</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

  <p>"Though I participate not in the follies of that fly who thought herself to raise
  the dust because she sat on the chariot-wheel, yet I am so far from disavowing my
  honest ambition of my master's favour, as I am desirous that the world should hold me,
  not so much his creature, by the undeserved honours I hold from his grace and power, as
  my desire to be the shadow of his mind, and to frame my judgment, knowledge, and
  affections according to his. Towards whose Royal Person I shall glory more to be always
  found an honest and humble subject, than I should to command absolutely in any other
  calling."</p>

  <p>Of those who threaten him he says very little, assuming, however, as self-evident,
  that they are set on by some priest, who, after the manner of his tribe, doth "carry
  the unlearned Catholics, like hawks hooded, into those dangerous positions."</p>

  <p>But, as for himself, let the world understand that he is not the man to neglect his
  duty on account of the personal danger it entails. "Far I hope it shall be from me, who
  know so well in whose <span class="smcap">Holy Book</span> my days are numbered, once
  to entertain a thought to purchase a span of time, at so dear a rate, as for the fear
  of any mortal power, in my poor talent, <i>Aut Deo, aut Patri&aelig;, aut Patri
  patri&aelig; deesse</i>."<sup><a name="FN440A" id="FN440A"></a><a href=
  "#FN440">[440]</a></sup></p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

  <p>In spite of the singular ability of this manifesto, the art of the writer is
  undoubtedly somewhat too conspicuous to permit us to accept it as the kind of document
  which would be produced by one who felt himself confronted by a serious peril. An
  interesting and most pertinent commentary is supplied by a contemporary Jesuit, Giles
  Schondonck, Rector of St. Omers College, in a letter to Father Baldwin, the same of
  whom we have already heard in connection with the Plot.<sup><a name="FN441A" id=
  "FN441A"></a><a href="#FN441">[441]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Schondonck has, he says, read and re-read Cecil's book, which Baldwin had lent him.
  If his opinion be required, he finds in it many flowers of wit and eloquence, and it is
  a composition well adapted for its object; but the original letter which has evoked
  this brilliant rejoinder is a manifest fraud, not emanating from any Catholic, but
  devised by the enemies of the Church for her injury. The writers plainly contradict
  themselves. They begin by denouncing the Powder Plot as impious and abominable, and
  they do so most righteously, and they declare its authors to have been turbulent
  spirits and not religious, in which also they are right. But they go on to approve the
  design of murdering Cecil. What sense is there in this? If the one design be impious
  and detestable, with what <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg
  223]</a></span>colour or conscience can the other be approved? There is no difference
  of principle, though in the one case many were to be murdered, in the other but a
  single man. No one having in him any spark of religion could defend either project,
  much less approve it. Moreover, much that is set down is simply ridiculous. Men in the
  last extremity of sickness, or broken down by sorrow, are not of the stuff whereof
  those are made by whom desperate deeds are done.</p>

  <p>From another Jesuit we obtain instructive information which at least serves to show
  what was the opinion of Catholics as to the way in which things were being managed.
  This is conveyed in a letter addressed December 1st, 1606, to the famous Father Parsons
  by Father Richard Blount, Father Garnet's successor as superior of the English
  mission.<sup><a name="FN442A" id="FN442A"></a><a href="#FN442">[442]</a></sup> It must
  be remembered that this was not meant for the public eye, and in fact was never
  published. It cannot have been intended to obtain credence for a particular version of
  history, and it was written to him who, of all men, was behind the scenes so far as the
  English Jesuits were concerned. Much of it is in cipher which, fortunately, has been
  interpreted for us by the recipient.</p>

  <p>Blount begins with a piece of intelligence which is startling enough. Amongst the
  lords of the council none was a more zealous enemy of Popery than the chamberlain, the
  Earl of Suffolk,<sup><a name="FN443A" id="FN443A"></a><a href="#FN443">[443]</a></sup>
  who was more than once on the commission for expelling priests and Jesuits, and had in
  particular been so energetic in the matter of the Powder Plot that Salisbury modestly
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>confessed
  that in regard of the "discovery" he had himself been "much less forward."<sup><a name=
  "FN444A" id="FN444A"></a><a href="#FN444">[444]</a></sup> Now, however, we are told,
  only a twelvemonth later, that this nobleman and his wife are ready for a sufficient
  fee to procure "some kind of peace" for the Catholics. The needful sum may probably be
  raised through the Spanish Ambassador, but the issue is doubtful "because Salisbury
  will resist."&mdash;"Yet such is the want of money with the chamberlain at this
  time&mdash;whose expenses are infinite&mdash;that either Salisbury must supply, or else
  he must needs break with him."<sup><a name="FN445A" id="FN445A"></a><a href=
  "#FN445">[445]</a></sup></p>

  <p>After some particulars concerning the jealousy against the Scots, and the matter of
  the union (which "sticketh much in the Parliament's teeth") Blount goes on to relate
  how Cecil has been attempting to float a second Powder Plot&mdash;the scene being this
  time the king's court itself. He has had another letter brought in, to set it going,
  and had seemingly calculated on capturing the writer himself and some of his brethren
  in connection with it. In this, however, he has been foiled, and the matter appears to
  have been dropped. In Blount's own words:<sup><a name="FN446A" id="FN446A"></a><a href=
  "#FN446">[446]</a></sup></p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

  <p>"Now these last days we expected some new stratagem, because Salisbury pretended a
  letter to be brought to his lordship found by chance in St. Clement's Churchyard,
  written in ciphers, wherein were many persons named, and a question asked, whether
  there were any concavity under the stage in the court. But belike the device failed,
  and so we hear no words of it. About this time this house was ransacked, where by
  chance Blount came late the night before, finding four more, Talbot, N. Smith, Wright,
  Arnold; being all besieged from morning to night. If things had fallen out as was
  expected, then that letter would have haply been spoken of, whereas now it is very
  secret, and only served to pick a thanks of King James, with whom Salisbury keepeth his
  credit by such tricks, as upon whose vigilancy his majesty's life dependeth."</p>
  <hr class='c14' />

  <p>One other feature of the after history demands consideration. As Fuller tells
  us,<sup><a name="FN447A" id="FN447A"></a><a href="#FN447">[447]</a></sup> "a learned
  author, making mention of this treason, breaketh forth into the following rapture:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="ni">'Excidat illa dies aevo, ne postera credant<br />
    Saecula; nos certe taceamus, et obruta mult&acirc;<br />
    Nocte tegi propriae patiamur crimina gentis.'<br />
    &nbsp;</p>

    <p class="ni">'Oh, let that day be quite dashed out of time,<br />
    <span class="c10">And not believ'd by the next generation;</span><br />
    In night of silence we'll conceal the crime,<br />
    <span class="c10">Thereby to save the credit of the nation.'"</span></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>"A wish," he adds, "which in my opinion, hath more of poetry than of piety therein,
  and from which I must be <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg
  226]</a></span>forced to dissent." Assuredly if it were judged that silence and
  oblivion should be the lot of the conspiracy, no stranger means were ever adopted to
  secure the desired object. A public thanksgiving was appointed to be held every year,
  on the anniversary of the "discovery;" a special service for that day was inserted in
  the Anglican liturgy, and Gunpowder Plot Sermons kept the memory of the Treason green
  in the mind not of one but of many generations.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the country was flooded with literature on the subject, in prose and
  rhyme, and the example of Milton is sufficient to show how favourite a topic it was
  with youthful poets essaying to try their wings.<sup><a name="FN448A" id=
  "FN448A"></a><a href="#FN448">[448]</a></sup></p>

  <p>In regard of the history, one line was consistently adopted. The Church of England
  in its calendar marked November 5th, as the <i>Papists' Conspiracy</i>, and in the
  collect appointed for the day the king and estates of the realm were described as being
  "by Popish treachery appointed as sheep to the slaughter, in a most barbarous and
  savage manner, beyond the examples of former ages." Similarly, preachers and writers
  alike concurred in saying little or nothing about the actual conspirators, but much
  about the iniquity of Rome; the official character of the Plot, and its sanction, even
  its first suggestion, by the highest authorities of the Church, being the chief feature
  of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>the tale
  hammered year after year into the ears of the English people. The details of history
  supplied are frequently pure and unmixed fables.<sup><a name="FN449A" id=
  "FN449A"></a><a href="#FN449">[449]</a></sup></p>

    "smcap">the powder plot. iv.</span></span>
  </div>

  <p>Nor was the pencil less active than the pen in popularizing the same belief. Great
  was the ingenuity spent in devising and producing pictures which should impress
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>on the minds
  of the most illiterate a holy horror of the Church which had doomed the nation to
  destruction. One of the most elaborate of these was headed by an inscription which
  admirably summarizes the moral of the tale.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">The Powder Treason.</span>&mdash;Propounded by <i>Satan</i>:
  Approved by <i>Antichrist</i> [<i>i.e.</i> the Pope]: Enterprised by <i>Papists</i>:
  Practized by <i>Traitors</i>: Revealed by an <i>Eagle</i> [Monteagle]: Expounded by an
  <i>Oracle</i> [King James]: Founded in <i>Hell</i>: Confounded in <i>Heaven</i>.</p>

  <p>Accordingly we find representations of Lucifer, the Pope, the King of Spain, the
  General of the Jesuits, and other such worthies, conspiring in the background while the
  redoubtable Guy walks arm in arm with a demon to fire the mine, the latter grasping a
  papal Bull (unknown to the Bullarium), expedited to promote the project: or again,
  Faukes and Catesby stand secretly conspiring in the middle of the street, while Father
  Garnet, in full Jesuit habit (or what is meant for such) exhorts them to go on: or a
  priest gives the conspirators "the sacrament of secrecy;" or representative Romish
  dignitaries blow threats and curses against England and her Parliament House,&mdash;or
  the Jesuits are buried in Hell in recompense of their perfidy.</p>

  <p>It cannot, however, escape remark that while the limners have been conscientiously
  careful in respect of these details, they have one and all discarded accuracy in regard
  of another matter in which we might naturally have expected it. In no single instance
  is Guy Faukes represented as about to blow up the right house. Sometimes it is the
  House of Commons that he is going to destroy, more frequently the Painted <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>Chamber, often a
  nondescript building corresponding to nothing in particular,&mdash;but in no single
  instance is it the House of Lords.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id=
  "Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

    "smcap">the powder plot. v.</span></span>
  </div>

  <p>The most extraordinary instance of so strange a vagary is afforded by a plate
  produced immediately after the occurrence it commemorates, in the year 1605
  itself.<sup><a name="FN450A" id="FN450A"></a><a href="#FN450">[450]</a></sup> In this,
  Faukes with his inseparable lantern, but without the usual spurs, is seen advancing to
  the door of the "cellar," which stands conspicuous above ground. Aloft is seen the
  crescent moon, represented in exactly the right phase for the date of the
  discovery.<sup><a name="FN451A" id="FN451A"></a><a href="#FN451">[451]</a></sup> The
  accuracy exhibited as to this singular detail makes it more than ever extraordinary
  that the building to which he directs his steps is unquestionably St. Stephen's
  Chapel&mdash;The House of Commons.</p>

  <p>One point of the history, in itself apparently insignificant, was at the time
  invested with such extravagant importance, as to suggest a question in its regard,
  namely the day itself whereon the marvellous deliverance took place. A curious
  combination of circumstances alone assigned it to the notorious Fifth of November.
  Parliament, as we have seen, was originally appointed to meet on the 3rd of October,
  but was suddenly adjourned for about a month, and so little reason did there seem to be
  for the prorogation<sup><a name="FN452A" id="FN452A"></a><a href=
  "#FN452">[452]</a></sup> as to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id=
  "Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>fill the conspirators with alarm lest some suspicion of
  their design had prompted it; wherefore they sent Thomas Winter to attend the
  prorogation ceremony, and observe the demeanour of those who took part in it.
  Afterwards, though the discovery might have easily been made any time during the
  preceding week, nothing practical was done till the fateful day itself had actually
  begun, when, as the acute Lingard has not failed to observe, a remarkable change at
  once came over the conduct of the authorities, who discarding the aimless and dilatory
  manner of proceeding which had hitherto characterized them, went straight to the point
  with a promptitude and directness leaving nothing to be desired.</p>

  <p>Whatever were their motive in all this, the action of the government undoubtedly
  brought it about that the great blow should be struck on a day which not a little
  enhanced the evidence for the providential character of the whole affair. Tuesday was
  King James' lucky day, more especially when it happened to be the 5th of the month, for
  on Tuesday, August the 5th, 1600, he had escaped the mysterious treason of the
  Gowries.</p>

  <p>This coincidence evidently created a profound impression. "Curious folks observe,"
  wrote Chamberlain to Carleton,<sup><a name="FN453A" id="FN453A"></a><a href=
  "#FN453">[453]</a></sup> "that this deliverance happened on the fifth of November,
  answerable to the fifth of August, both Tuesdays; and this plot to be executed by
  Johnson [the assumed name of Faukes], and that at Johnstown [<i>i.e.</i>, Perth]." On
  the 27th of November, Lake <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg
  232]</a></span>suggested to the Archbishop of Canterbury,<sup><a name="FN454A" id=
  "FN454A"></a><a href="#FN454">[454]</a></sup> that as a perpetual memorial of this so
  providential circumstance, the anniversary sermon should always be delivered upon a
  Tuesday. Two days later, the Archbishop wrote to his suffragans,<sup><a name="FN455A"
  id="FN455A"></a><a href="#FN455">[455]</a></sup> reminding them how on a Tuesday his
  majesty had escaped the Gowries, and now, on another Tuesday, a peril still more
  terrible, which must have ruined the whole nation, had not the Holy Ghost illumined the
  king's heart with a divine spirit. In remembrance of which singular instance of God's
  governance, there was to be an annual celebration.<sup><a name="FN456A" id=
  "FN456A"></a><a href="#FN456">[456]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Most important of all, King James himself much appreciated the significance of this
  token of divine protection, and not only impressed this upon his Parliament, but
  proroguing it forthwith till after Christmas, selected the same propitious day of the
  week for its next meeting, as a safeguard against possible danger. "Since it has
  pleased God," said his majesty,<sup><a name="FN457A" id="FN457A"></a><a href=
  "#FN457">[457]</a></sup> "to grant me two such notable deliveries upon one day of the
  week, which was Tuesday, and likewise one day of the month, which was the fifth,
  thereby to teach me that as it was the same devil that still persecuted me, so it was
  one and the same God that still mightily delivered me, I thought it therefore not
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>amiss, that
  the twenty-first day which fell to be upon Tuesday, should be the day of meeting of
  this next session of parliament, hoping and assuring myself, that the same God, who
  hath now granted me and you all so notable and gracious a delivery, shall prosper all
  our affairs at that next session, and bring them to an happy conclusion."</p>
  <hr class='c14' />

  <p>Whatever may be thought of this particular element of its history, it is perfectly
  clear that the fashion in which the Plot was habitually set before the English people,
  and which contributed more than anything else to work the effect actually produced, was
  characterized from the first by an utter disregard of truth on the part of those whose
  purposes it so opportunely served, and with such lasting results.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

  <h4><span class="smcap">A Summary.</span></h4>

  <p>The evidence available to us appears to establish principally two points,&mdash;that
  the true history of the Gunpowder Plot is now known to no man, and that the history
  commonly received is certainly untrue.</p>

  <p>It is quite impossible to believe that the government were not aware of the Plot
  long before they announced its discovery.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to believe that the proceedings of the conspirators were actually
  such as they are related to have been.</p>

  <p>It is unquestionable that the government consistently falsified the story and the
  evidence as presented to the world, and that the points upon which they most insisted
  prove upon examination to be the most doubtful.</p>

  <p>There are grave reasons for the conclusion that the whole transaction was
  dexterously contrived for the purpose which in fact it opportunely served, by those who
  alone reaped benefit from it, and who showed themselves so unscrupulous in the manner
  of reaping.</p>

    <i>An Answere to certaine Scandalous Papers, scattered abroad under colour of a
    Catholicke Admonition.</i> "Qui facit vivere, docet orare." Imprinted at London by
    Robert Barker, Printer to the King's most Eccellent Majestie. Anno 1606.</p>

    <p>This was published in January, 1605-6, on the 28th of which month Sir W. Browne,
    writing from Flushing, mentions that "my lord of Salisbury hath lately published a
    little booke as a kynd of answer to som secrett threatning libelling letters cast
    into his chamber." (Stowe MSS., 168, 74, f. 308.)</p>

    On this subject Cornwallis wrote to Salisbury (Winwood, ii. 193): "Many reports are
    here spread of the Combination against your Lordship, and that five English Romanists
    would resolve your death. It seems that since they cannot be allowed <i>Sacrificium
    incruentum</i>, they will now altogether put in use their sacrifices of blood. But I
    hope and suppose that their hearts and their hands want much of the vigour that rests
    in their wills and their pens. Your Lordship doth take especial courage in this, that
    they single you out as the chief and principal watch Tower of your Country and
    Commonwealth, and turn the strength of their malice to you whom they hold the
    discoverer of all their unnatural and destructive inventions against their prince and
    country," etc.</p>

    Father Blount's account is undoubtedly in keeping with what we know of the Earl, and
    especially of his Countess, who was a sister of Sir Thomas Knyvet, the captor of Guy
    Faukes. Suffolk, in 1614, became Lord High Treasurer, but four years afterwards grave
    irregularities were discovered in his office; he was accused of embezzlement and
    extortion, in which work his wife was proved to have been even more active than
    himself. They were sentenced to restore all money wrongfully extorted, to a fine of
    &pound;30,000, and to imprisonment during pleasure.</p>

    We have four Latin epigrams of Milton's, <i>In proditionem Bombardicam</i>, which,
    though pointless, are bitterly anti-Catholic. A longer poem, of 226 lines, <i>In

    <p>It is somewhat remarkable that the universal Shakespeare should make no allusion
    to the Plot, beyond the doubtful reference to equivocation in <i>Macbeth</i> (ii. 3).

    The reasons assigned in the proclamation for this prorogation are plainly
    insufficient: viz., "That the holding of it [the Parliament] so soone is not
    convenient, as well for that the ordinary course of our subjects resorting to the
    citie for their usuall affaires at the Terme is not for the most part till

  <h3>NOTES ON THE ILLUSTRATIONS.</h3>

  <h4 class="c16"><a href="#image1">Frontispiece.</a> The Powder Plot. I.</h4>

  <p class="ni"><span class="smcap">From</span> the Crace Collection, British Museum,
  <i>Portf.</i> xv. 20. Thus described in the catalogue of the collection:</p>

  <p>"A small etching of the House of Lords. Guy Fawkes in the foreground. W.E. exc.
  1605."</p>

  <p>This plate is of exceptional interest as having been executed within five months of
  the discovery of the Plot, <i>i.e.</i>, previously to March 25th, 1606, the first day
  of the year, Old Style.</p>

  <p>Guy Faukes is represented as approaching the House of Commons (St. Stephen's
  Chapel), not the House of Lords, as the catalogue says.</p>

  <h4 class="c16"><a href="#image2">Title-Page.</a></h4>

  <p>Obverse, or reverse, of a medal struck, by order of the Dutch senate, to commemorate
  the double event of the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot and the expulsion of the
  Jesuits from Holland. Drawn from a copy of the medal in pewter, by Paul Woodroffe. The
  design here exhibited is thus described in Hawkins and Frank's <i>Medallic
  Illustrations</i>:</p>

  <p>"The name of Jehovah, in Hebrew, radiate, within a crown of thorns.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

  <p>"Legend, chronogrammatic,</p>

  <blockquote>

  </blockquote>

  <p class="ni">[which gives the date 1605]</p>

  <p>On its other face the medal bears a snake gliding amid roses and lilies [symbolizing
  Jesuit intrigues in England and France], with the legend <i>Detectus qui latuit.
  S.C.</i> [Senatus Consulto]."</p>

  <p>This is reproduced on the cover.</p>

  <h4><i>Group of Conspirators</i> <a href="#image3">(p. 3).</a></h4>

  <p>From a print published at Amsterdam.</p>

  <p>Eight conspirators are represented, five being omitted, viz., Grant, Keyes, Digby,
  Rokewood, and Tresham.</p>

  <p>Bates, as a servant, wears no hat.</p>

  <h4><i>The Houses of Parliament in the time of James I.</i> <a href="#image4">(pp.

  <p>Restored from the best authorities, and drawn for the author by H.W. Brewer.</p>

  <h4><i>Ground Plan of House of Lords and adjacent Buildings</i> <a href="#image6">(p.
  59).</a></h4>

  <p>Extracted from the "Foundation plan of the Ancient Palace of Westminster; measured,
  drawn and engraved by J.T. Smith" (<i>Antiquities of Westminster</i>, p. 125)</p>

  <h4><i>The House of Lords in 1807</i> <a href="#image7">(p. 61).</a></h4>

  <p>From J.T. Smith's <i>Antiquities of Westminster</i>.</p>

  <p>This sketch, made from the east, or river, side, was taken during the demolition of
  the buildings erected <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg
  237]</a></span>against the sides of the Parliament House. These were put up previously
  to the time when Hollar made his drawing of the interior (temp. Charles II.), which
  shows the walls hung with tapestry, the windows having been blocked up.</p>

  <p>According to a writer in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> (No. 70, July, 1800), who
  signs himself "Architect," in a print of the time of James I. the tapestry is not seen,
  and the House "appears to have preserved much of its original work." The only print
  answering to this description which I have been able to find exhibits the windows, but
  is of no value for historical purposes, as it is a reproduction of one of the time of
  Queen Elizabeth, the figure of the sovereign alone being changed. This engraving is
  said to be "taken from a painted print in the Cottonian Library," of which I can find
  no trace. [B. Mus., K. 24. 19. b.]</p>

  <p>To the left of our illustration is seen the gable of the Prince's Chamber. The door
  to the right of this opened into the cellar, and by it, according to tradition, Faukes
  was to have made his exit.</p>

  <p>In front of this is seen part of the garden attached to Percy's lodging.</p>

  <h4><i>Interior of "Guy Faukes' Cellar"</i> <a href="#image8">(p. 71).</a></h4>

  <p>Two views of the interior of the "cellar," drawn by H.W. Brewer, from elevations in
  J.T. Smith's <i>Antiquities of Westminster</i>, p. 39.</p>

  <p>The remains of a buttery-hatch, at the southern end, testify to the ancient use of
  the chamber as the palace kitchen; of which the Earl of Northampton made mention at
  Father Garnet's trial.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

  <p>The very ancient doorway in the eastern wall, seen on the left of the picture, was
  of Saxon workmanship, and, like the foundations beneath, probably dated from the time
  of Edward the Confessor, who first erected this portion of the palace, most of which
  had been rebuilt about the time of Henry III. By this doorway, according to some
  accounts, Faukes intended to escape after firing the train, though others assign this
  distinction to one near the other end.</p>

  <p>These two illustrations were originally prepared for the <i>Daily Graphic</i> of
  November 5th, 1894, and it is by the courtesy of the proprietors of that journal that
  they are here reproduced.</p>

  <h4><i>Vault under the East End of the Painted Chamber</i> <a href="#image9">(p.
  73).</a></h4>

  <p>From Brayley and Britton's <i>Palace of Westminster</i>, p. 247.</p>

  <p>This has been constantly depicted and described as "Guy Faukes' Cellar."</p>

  <h4><i>Arches from Guy Faukes' Cellar</i> <a href="#image10">(p. 75).</a></h4>

  <p>Drawn for the author by H.W. Brewer.</p>

  <p>Sir John Soane, who in 1823 took down the old House of Lords, removed the arches
  from the "cellar" beneath it, to his own house in Lincoln's Inn Fields, now the Soane
  Museum, where they are still to be seen in a small court adjoining the building. They
  do not, however, appear to have been set up precisely in their original form, being
  dwarfed by the omission of some stones, presumably that they might occupy less space.
  In our illustration they are represented exactly as they <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>now stand, with the modern building behind
  them. Some incongruous relics of other stonework which have been introduced amongst
  them have, however, been omitted.</p>

  <p>The architecture of these arches, and of the adjacent Prince's Chamber, assigns them
  to the best period of thirteenth century Gothic.</p>

  <h4><i>Cell at S.E. corner of Painted Chamber</i> <a href="#image11">(p. 83).</a></h4>

  <p>Often styled "Guy Faukes' Cell."</p>

  <p>From Brayley and Britton, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 360.</p>

  <p>There appears to be no reason for associating this with Faukes.</p>

  <h4><i>The Powder Plot. II.</i> <a href="#image12">(p. 90).</a></h4>

  <p>"Invented by Samuel Ward, Preacher, of Ipswich. Imprinted at Amsterdam, 1621."
  [British Museum, <i>Political and Personal Satires</i>, i. 41.]</p>

  <p>This is the portion to the right of a composition representing on the left the
  Spanish Armada, and in the centre a council table at which are gathered the Devil, the
  Pope, the King of Spain, the General of the Jesuits, and others. An eye above is fixed
  on the cellar. Faukes in this case is going to blow up the Painted Chamber.</p>

  <h4><i>Interior of the old House of Lords (Scene on occasion of the King's Speech,
  1755)</i> <a href="#image13">(p. 97).</a></h4>

  <p>This plate represents the House in the reign of George II. In the century and a half
  since the time of the Powder Plot it is probable that the windows <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>in the side walls had
  been blocked up, and the tapestry hung. The latter represented the defeat of the
  Armada.</p>

  <p>[From Maitland's <i>London</i> (1756), ii. 1340.]</p>

  <h4><i>Lord Monteagle and the Letter</i> <a href="#image14">(p. 115).</a></h4>

  <p>From <i>Mischeefes Mystery</i>.</p>

  <p>King James enthroned, with crown and sceptre, upon a da&iuml;s, at the foot of which
  stands the Earl of Salisbury. An eagle bears a letter in its beak, to receive which the
  king and his minister extend their left hands.</p>

  <p>The English poem, by John Vicars, embellished with this woodcut, was published in
  1617, being a much expanded version of one in Latin hexameters, entitled <i>Pietas
  Pontificia</i>, by Francis Herring, which appeared in 1606.</p>

  <h4><i>Arrest of Guy Faukes</i> <a href="#image15">(p. 125).</a></h4>

  <p>From <i>Mischeefes Mystery</i>.</p>

  <p>Guy Faukes booted and spurred, and with his lantern, prepares to open a door at the
  extremity of the Painted Chamber. Sir Thomas Knyvet with his retinue approaches unseen.
  The stars and the beams from the lantern show that it is the middle of the night.</p>

  <h4><i>Discovery of the Gunpowder Plot</i> <a href="#image16">(p. 136).</a></h4>

  <p>From a print in the Guildhall Library.</p>

  <p>Catesby, Faukes, and Garnet (the latter in what is apparently meant for the Jesuit
  habit) stand in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg
  241]</a></span>middle of the street conspiring secretly. Through the open door of the
  "cellar" the powder barrels are seen.</p>

  <p>This illustration (without the coins) stands at the head of Book XVIII. of M. Rapin
  de Thoyras' <i>History of England</i>, translated by N. Tindal.</p>

  <h4>"<i>Guy Faukes' Lantern</i>" <a href="#image17">(p. 139).</a></h4>

  <p>Drawn by H.W. Brewer.</p>

  <p>This object, the authenticity of which is not unquestionable, is exhibited in the
  Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. It bears the inscription, "Laterna illa ipsa qua usus est, et
  cum qua deprehensus Guido Faux in crypta subterranea ubi domo Parliamenti
  diffland&aelig; operam dabat. Ex dono Robti Heywood nuper Academiae Procuratoris, Ap.
  4<sup>o</sup>, 1641."</p>

  <p>It will be remembered that the honour of having arrested Faukes has been claimed for
  one of the name of Heywood.</p>

  <p>The history of the famous lantern has not escaped the variations which we are
  accustomed to meet with on other points. Faukes is generally said to have been found
  with it in his hands, and it has consequently become an inseparable adjunct in pictures
  of him. On the other hand, we are told, "In a corner, behind the door, was a dark
  lantern containing a light" (Brayley and Britton, <i>Palace of Westminster</i>, p.
  377).</p>

  <h4><i>Thomas Percy</i> <a href="#image18">(p. 149).</a></h4>

  <p>From Grainger.</p>

  <p>Around the portrait are four small engravings representing:</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

  <ol>
    <li>The arrest of Guy Faukes, who is here called "Thomas Ichrup."</li>

    <li>The presentation of Thomas Ichrup to the King of Jerusalem (<i>i.e.</i>, the
    British Solomon).</li>

    <li>The assault and bombardment of the "citadel" to which Percy has fled.</li>

    <li>Percy killed by an arrow.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4><i>Thomas Winter's Confession</i> <a href="#image19">(p. 168).</a></h4>

  <p>A portion of the copy of Winter's confession, in the handwriting of Levinus Munck,
  Lord Salisbury's private secretary, and dated November 23rd. In the margin is a note in
  the handwriting of King James, objecting to a certain "uncleare phrase," which has been
  altered in accordance with the royal wish. In the printed version it appears in the
  amended form.</p>

  <h4><i>Signatures exemplifying the Effects of Torture</i> <a href="#image20">(p.
  173).</a></h4>

  <p>Three signatures of Faukes (November 9th, 1605), and three of Father Edward Oldcorne
  (March 6th, 1605-6), at different stages of the same examination.</p>

  <h4><i>Guy Faukes' Confession of November 9th, 1605</i> <a href="#image21">(p.
  199).</a></h4>

  <p>A portion of this confession, in which Faukes speaks of the oath taken by the
  conspirators and of their reception of the sacrament at the hands of Father John
  Gerard, adding, however, that "Gerard was not acquainted with their purpose." The last
  clause has been marked for omission by Sir Edward Coke who has written in the margin
  <i>hucusq</i>. ("thus far").</p>

  <p>The letter B in the margin is also inserted by Coke, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>who habitually indicated by such letters
  which portions of the depositions were to be read in court and which omitted, all being
  always suppressed which told in any way in favour of the accused.</p>

  <p>The document is written by a clerk, and signed by Faukes at the foot of each
  page.</p>

  <h4><i>The Powder Plot. III.</i> <a href="#image22">(p. 215).</a></h4>

  <p>This is taken from a large plate [British Museum, <i>Political and Personal
  Satires</i>, i. 67], of which only the lower portion is here reproduced. At the top is
  the inscription:</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">The Powder Treason</span>, Propounded by Sathan, Approved by
  Anti-Christ, Enterprised by Papists, Practized by Traitors, Reveled by an Eagle,
  Expounded by an Oracle.&mdash;Founded in Hell, Confounded in Heaven.</p>

  <p>Beneath are many emblematical devices.</p>

  <p>In the portion here exhibited, King James is seen on his throne with Lords and
  Commons before him. Under the floor is a diminutive figure of Faukes with an ample
  store of barrels. At the bottom, in the left hand corner, some of the conspirators
  receive the sacrament from Father Gerard: on the right they are executed. On a lunette
  are the thirteen conspirators, with the arch-traitor Garnet in the centre, the band
  being described as "The Pope's Saltpeeter Saints." Within the lunette are the Jesuits
  in Hell.</p>

  <h4><i>The Powder Plot. IV.</i> <a href="#image23">(p. 227).</a></h4>

  <p>This is the portion on the left of a composite picture [British Museum, <i>Political
  and Personal <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg
  244]</a></span>Satires</i>, 63], on the right being represented the catastrophe known
  as the "Blackfriars Downfall." On Sunday, October 26th, 1623, many Catholics having
  assembled in an upper room of the French ambassador's house, in Blackfriars, to hear a
  sermon from the Jesuit, Father Drury, the floor collapsed, and many, including the
  preacher, were killed. As October 26th, O.S., corresponded to November 5th, N.S., it
  was ingeniously discovered that the accident was meant to signalize Gunpowder Plot day,
  though this fell on November 5th, O.S., or November 15th, N.S.</p>

  <p>In our illustration the Parliament House is represented by a nondescript edifice,
  the wall of which is partially removed, showing King James and some of the Peers. An
  oven-like vault beneath represents the "cellar," well stored with barrels, which Faukes
  is preparing to light with a torch fanned by a crowned fiend with a pair of bellows. A
  company of halberdiers approaches under the guidance of an angel. In the background is
  a royal funeral procession.</p>

  <p>A Latin inscription is attached which runs thus:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><small>"Anno 1623, Quinto Novembris, eo scripto die quo Angli&aelig; Parliamentum,
    a<sup>o</sup> 1605, proditione et insidiis Jesuitarum, pulvere nitreo inflammari et

  <h4><i>The Powder Plot. V.</i> <a href="#image24">(p. 229).</a></h4>

  <p>This is an edition of Samuel Ward's print described above, improved and embellished
  by a "Transmariner" in 1689. [British Museum, <i>Political and Personal Satires</i>, i.
  43.]</p>

  <p>The tent in which the council table stands is ornamented at the four corners with
  figures of a wolf, a parrot, an owl, and a dragon: a cockatrice is on the table; on the
  top lie a gun, a sword, and a brace of pistols. A demon, bearing behind him a Papal
  Bull, accompanies Faukes, beneath whose lantern, as a play on his name, is written
  <i>Fax</i>. At the door of the cellar are scorpions and a serpent. On the top of the
  barrels within are seen the "yron barres," placed there to make the breach the
  greater.</p>

  <h4 class="c16">Sir Everard Digby's letter to Salisbury.</h4>

  <p class="ni"><span class="smcap">It</span> seems to have been always assumed that this
  celebrated letter, which is undated, was written after the failure of the Gunpowder
  Plot, and the consequent arrest of Sir Everard, and doubtless to some extent internal
  evidence supports this view, as the writer speaks of himself as deserving punishment,
  and of "our offence." It is, moreover, clear that the letter, which is undated, cannot
  have been written before May 4th, 1605, the date of Cecil's earldom. On the other hand,
  the whole tone of the document appears utterly inconsistent with the supposition that
  it was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg
  246]</a></span>written by one branded with the stigma of such a crime as the Powder
  Plot. Some of the expressions used, especially in the opening sentence, appear,
  likewise, incompatible with such a supposition, and the letter bears the usual form of
  address for those sent in ordinary course of post, "To the Right Hon. the Earl of
  Salisburie give these"; it has moreover been sealed with a crest or coat-of-arms; all
  of which is quite unlike a document prepared by a prisoner for those who had him under
  lock and key. It is noteworthy, too, that at the trial, according to the testimony of
  the official account itself, on the very subject of the treatment of Catholics,
  Salisbury acknowledged "that Sir E. Digby was his ally."</p>

  <p>It seems probable, therefore, that the letter was written before Digby had been
  entangled by Catesby in the conspiracy (<i>i.e.</i>, between May and September, 1605).
  If so, what was the "offence" of which he speaks? The answer to this question would
  throw an interesting light on this perplexed history. The following is Sir Everard's
  letter:</p>

  <p>"Right Honourable, I have better reflected on your late speeches than at the present
  I could do, both for the small stay which I made, and for my indisposition that day,
  not being very well, and though perhaps your Lordship may judge me peremptory in
  meddling, and idle in propounding, yet the desire I have to establish the King in
  safety will not suffer me to be silent."</p>

  <p>"One part of your Lordship's speech (as I remember) was that the King could not get
  so much from the Pope (even then when his Majesty had done nothing against Catholics)
  as a promise that he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg
  247]</a></span> not excommunicate him, so long as that mild course was continued,
  wherefore it gave occasion to suspect, that if Catholics were suffered to increase, the
  Pope might afterwards proceed to excommunication, if the King would not change his
  religion. But to take away that doubt, I do assure myself that his Holiness may be
  drawn to manifest so contrary a disposition of excommunicating the King, that he will
  proceed with the same course against all such as shall go about to disturb the King's
  quiet and happy reign; and the willingness of Catholics, especially of priests and
  Jesuits, is such as I dare undertake to procure any priest in England (though it were
  the Superior of the Jesuits) to go himself to Rome to negotiate this business, and that
  both he and all other religious men (till the Pope's pleasure be known) shall take any
  spiritual course to stop the effect that may proceed from any discontented or
  despairing Catholic."</p>

  <p>"And I doubt not but his return would bring both assurance that such course should
  not be taken with the King, and that it should be performed against any that should
  seek to disturb him for religion. If this were done, there could then be no cause to
  fear any Catholic, and this may be done only with those proceedings (which as I
  understood your lordship) should be used. If your Lordship apprehend it to be worth the
  doing, I shall be glad to be the instrument, for no hope to put off from myself any
  punishment, but only that I wish safety to the King and ease to Catholics. If your
  Lordship and the State think it fit to deal severely with Catholics, within brief there
  will be massacres, rebellions, and desperate attempts against the King and State. For
  it is a general received reason<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id=
  "Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> amongst Catholics, that there is not that expecting and
  suffering course now to be run that was in the Queen's time, who was the last of her
  line, and last in expectance to run violent courses against Catholics; for then it was
  hoped that the King that now is would have been at least free from persecuting, as his
  promise was before his coming into this realm, and as divers his promises have been
  since his coming, saying that he would take no soul money nor blood. Also, as it
  appeared, was the whole body of the Council's pleasure, when they sent for divers of
  the better sort of Catholics (as Sir Thos. Tressam and others) and told them it was the
  King's pleasure to forgive the payment of Catholics, so long as they should carry
  themselves dutifully and well. All these promises every man sees broken, and to thrust
  them further in despair, most Catholics take note of a vehement book written by Mr.
  Attorney, whose drift (as I have heard) is to prove that the only being a Catholic is
  to be a traitor, which book coming forth, after the breach of so many promises, and
  before the ending of such a violent parliament, can work no less effect in men's minds
  than a belief that every Catholic will be brought within that compass before the King
  and State have done with them. And I know, as the priest himself told me, that if he
  had not hindered there had somewhat been attempted, before our offence, to give ease to
  Catholics. But being so safely prevented, and so necessary to avoid, I doubt not but
  your Lordship and the rest of the Lords will think of a more mild and undoubted safe
  course, in which I will undertake the performance of what I have promised and as much
  as can be expected, and when I have done, I shall be as<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> willing to die as I am ready to offer my
  service, and expect not nor desire favour for it, either before the doing it, nor in
  the doing it, nor after it is done, but refer myself to the resolved course for me. So,
  leaving to trouble your Lordship any further, I humbly take my leave. Your Lordship's
  poor bedesman, <span class="smcap">Ev. Digby</span>."</p>

  <h4 class="c16">The Question of Succession.</h4>

  <p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Father Parsons'</span> well-known book on this
  subject, written under the pseudonym of Doleman, was denounced by Sir Edward Coke as
  containing innumerable treasons and falsehoods. In fact, as may be seen in the work
  itself, it is an exhaustive and careful statement of the descent of each of the
  possible claimants, and of other considerations which must enter into the settlement.
  Sir Francis Inglefield wrote that it was necessary to take some step of this kind, to
  set men thinking on so important a question which would soon have to be decided, for
  that the anti-Catholic party had made it treason to discuss it during the queen's life,
  with intent to foist a successor of their <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id=
  "Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>own selection on the nation, when the moment should
  arrive, trusting to the ignorance universally prevalent as to the rights of the matter;
  but that such lack of information could not help the people to a sound decision.
  [Stonyhurst MSS., <i>Anglia</i>, iii. 32.]</p>

  <p>The Spanish sympathies of Parsons and his party were afterwards made much of as
  evidence of their traitorous disposition. On this subject it must be noted (1) the
  Infanta of Spain was amongst those whose claim was urged on genealogical grounds; (2)
  the project was to marry her to an English nobleman. As Parsons tells us, when she
  married and was endowed with another estate, English Catholics ceased to think of her.
  [<i>Ibid.</i> ii. 444.] (3) Father Garnet notes that, "since the old king of Spain died
  [1598], there hath been no pretence ... for the Infanta, or the King [of Spain], or any
  of that family, but for any that should maintain Catholic religion, and principally for
  His Majesty" [James I.]. [<i>Ibid.</i> iii. n. 41.]</p>

  <p>A remark of Parsons' on this point, which at the time was considered almost
  blasphemous, will seem now almost a truism, viz., that the title of particular
  succession in kingdoms is founded only upon the positive laws of several countries,
  since neither kingdoms nor monarchies are of the essence of human society, and
  therefore every nation has a right to establish its own kings in what manner it likes,
  and upon what conditions. Wherefore, as each of the other great parties in England
  (whom he designates as Protestants and Puritans) will look chiefly to its own political
  interests, and exact from the monarch of its choice pledges to secure them, it behoves
  Catholics, being so large a part of the nation, to take their proper <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>share in the settlement,
  and therefore to study betimes the arguments on which the claims of the competitors are
  severally based.</p>

  <p class="ni"><span class="smcap">That</span> the lodging hired by Percy stood near the
  south-east corner of the old House of Lords (<i>i.e</i>. nearer to the river than that
  building, and adjacent to, if not adjoining, the Prince's Chamber) is shown by the
  following arguments.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>John Shepherd, servant to Whynniard, gave evidence as to having on a certain
    occasion seen from the river "a boat lye cloase to the pale of Sir Thomas Parreys
    garden, and men going to and from the water <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252"
    id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>through the back door that leadeth into Mr. Percy

    <li>Faukes, in his examination of November 5th, 1605, speaks of "the windowe in his
    chamber neere the parliament house towards the water side."</li>

    <li>It is said that when digging their mine the conspirators were troubled by the
    influx of water from the river, which would be impossible if they were working at the
    opposite side of the Parliament House.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>[It has always been understood that Percy's house stood at the south end of the
  House of Lords, but Smith (<i>Antiquities of Westminster</i>, p. 39) places it to the

  <h4 class="c16">Enrolment of Conspirators.</h4>

  <p>The evidence on this point is most contradictory.</p>

  <p>1. The Indictment, on the trial of the conspirators, mentions the following
  dates.</p>

  <p><i>May 20th, 1604.</i> [Besides Garnet, Greenway, Gerard, "and other Jesuits,"]
  there met together T. Winter, Faukes, Keyes, Bates, Catesby, Percy, the two Wrights,
  and Tresham, by whom the Plot was approved and undertaken.</p>

  <p><i>March 31st, 1605</i>, R. Winter, Grant, and Rokewood were enlisted.</p>

  <p>[No mention is made of Digby, who was separately arraigned, nor in his arraignment
  is any date specified.]</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

  <p>2. According to Faukes' confession of November 17th, 1605, Percy, Catesby, T.
  Winter, J. Wright, and himself were the first associates. Soon afterwards C. Wright was
  added. After Christmas, Keyes was initiated and received the oath. At a later period,
  Digby, Rokewood, Tresham, Grant, and R. Winter were brought in. Bates is not
  mentioned.</p>

  <p>[In this document the names of Keyes and R. Winter have been interchanged, in
  Cecil's writing, and thus it was printed: the latter being made to appear as an earlier
  confederate.]</p>

  <p>3. According to T. Winter's declaration of November 23rd, 1605, Catesby, J. Wright,
  and himself were the first associates, Percy and Faukes being presently added. Keyes
  was enlisted before Michaelmas, C. Wright after Christmas, Digby at a later period, and
  Tresham "last of all." No others are mentioned.</p>

  <p>4. Keyes&mdash;November 30th, 1605&mdash;says that he was inducted a little before
  Midsummer, 1604.</p>

  <p>5. R. Winter and Grant (January 17th, 1605-6) fix January, 1604-5, for their
  introduction to the conspiracy, and Bates (December 4th, 1605) gives the preceding
  December for his. Neither date agrees with that of the indictment in support of which
  these confessions were cited.</p>

  <p>6. There is, of course, no evidence of any kind to show that Father Garnet and the
  "other Jesuits" ever had any conference with the conspirators, nor was such a charge
  urged on his trial.</p>

  <p>7. Sir Everard Digby's case is exceptionally puzzling. All the evidence represents
  him as having been initiated late in September, or early in October, 1605. Among the
  Hatfield MSS., however, there is a letter addressed <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>to Sir Everard, by one G.D., and dated June
  11th, 1605, which treats ostensibly of a hunt for "the otter that infesteth your
  brooks," to be undertaken when the hay has been cut, but has been endorsed by Cecil
  himself, "Letter written to Sir Everard Digby&mdash;<i>Powder Treason</i>;" the
  minister thus attributing to him a knowledge of the Plot, more than three months before
  it was ever alleged that he heard of it.</p>

  <h4 class="c16">The Use of Torture.</h4>

  <p class="ni"><span class="smcap">There</span> can be no doubt that torture was freely
  employed to extract evidence from the conspirators and others who fell into the hands
  of the government.</p>

  <p>The Earl of Salisbury, in his letter to Favat, of December 4th, 1605, clearly
  intimates that this was the case, when he complains "most of the prisoners have
  wilfully forsworn that the priests knew anything in particular, and obstinately refuse
  to be accusers of them, <i>yea, what torture soever they be put to</i>."</p>

  <p>About the middle of November, Lord Dunfermline wrote to Salisbury [<i>Dom. James
  I.</i> xvi. 81] recommending that the prisoners should be confined apart and in
  darkness, that they should be examined by torchlight, and that the tortures should be
  slow and at intervals, as being thus most effectual.</p>

  <p>There is every reason to believe that the Jesuit lay-brother, Nicholas Owen,
  <i>alias</i> Littlejohn, actually died upon the rack. [<i>Vide</i> Father Gerard's
  <i>Narrative of the Gunpowder Plot</i>, p. 189.]</p>

  <p>Finally we have the king's instructions as to Faukes [<i>Gunpowder Plot Book</i>,
  No. 17]. "The gentler tortours are to be first usid unto him, <i>et sic per gradus

  <h4 class="c16">Myths and Legends of the Powder Plot.</h4>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

  <p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Around</span> the Gunpowder Plot has gathered a mass
  of fabulous embellishment too curious to be passed over in silence. This has chiefly
  attached itself to Guy Faukes, who, on account of the desperate part allotted to him
  has impressed the public mind far more than any of his associates, and has come to be
  erroneously regarded as the moving spirit of the enterprise.</p>

  <p>One of the best authenticated facts regarding him is that when apprehended he was
  booted and spurred for a journey, though it is usually said that he was to have
  travelled by water.</p>

  <p>There is, however, a strange story, told with much circumstantiality, which gives an
  elaborate but incomprehensible account of a tragic underplot in connection with him.
  This is related at considerable length in a Latin hexameter poem, <i>Venatio
  Catholica</i>, published in 1609, in the <i>History of the Popish Sham Plots</i>, and
  elsewhere. According to this tangled tale the other conspirators wished both to get rid
  of Faukes, when he had served their purpose, and to throw the suspicion of their deed
  upon their enemies, the Puritans. To this end they devised a notable scheme. A certain
  Puritan, named Pickering, a courtier, but a godly man, foremost amongst his party, had
  a fine horse ("Bucephalum egregium"). This, Robert Keyes, his brother-in-law, purchased
  or hired, and placed at the service of Faukes for his escape. The steed was to await
  him at a certain spot, but in a wood hard by assassins were to lurk, who, when Guy
  appeared, should murder him, and having secured the money with which he was furnished,
  should leave his mangled corpse beside the Bucephalus, known as Mr. Pickering's. Thus
  Faukes would be able to tell no tales, and&mdash;though it does not appear
  why&mdash;suspicion would be sure to fall on the <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>Puritan, and he would be proclaimed as the
  author of the recent catastrophe.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="ni"><small>"Hoc astu se posse rati convertere in hostes<br />
    Flagitii infamiam, causamque capessere vulgo<br />
    Qua Puritanos invisos reddere possent,<br />

    Sublato."</small></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Many curious circumstances have likewise been imported into the history, and many
  places connected with it which appear to have no claim whatever to such a
  distinction.</p>

  <p>Thus we hear (<i>England's Warning Peece</i>) that the Jesuit Cresswell came over
  from Spain for the occasion "to bear his part with the rest of his society in a
  victorial song of thanksgiving." Also that on November 5th, a large body of
  confederates assembled at Hampstead to see the House of Parliament go up in the
  air.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, February, 1783, is a remarkable description of a
  summer house, in a garden at Newton Hall, near Kettering, Northamptonshire, in which
  the plotters used to meet and conspire, the place then belonging to the Treshams; "and
  for greater security, they placed a conspirator at each window, Guy Faukes, the arch
  villain, standing in the doorway, to prevent anybody overhearing them."</p>

  <p>According to a wide-spread belief Guy Faukes was a Spaniard.<sup><a name="FN461A"
  id="FN461A"></a><a href="#FN461">[461]</a></sup> He has also been called a Londoner,
  and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>his name
  being altered to Vaux, has been said to have a family connection with Vauxhall. He was
  in fact a Yorkshireman of good family, though belonging to a younger branch of no great
  estate. His father, Edward Faukes, was a notary at York, where he held the office of
  registrar and advocate of the cathedral church. Guy himself was an educated man, more
  than commonly well read. He is always described in the process as "Guido Faukes,
  Gentleman."</p>

  <p>Another most extraordinary example of an obvious myth, which was nevertheless
  treated as sober history, is furnished by the absurd statement that the astute and wily
  Jesuits not only contrived the Plot, but published its details to the world long before
  its attempted execution, in order to vindicate to themselves the credit of so glorious
  a design. Thus Bishop Kennet, in a fifth of November sermon, preached at St. Paul's
  before the Lord Mayor, in 1715, tells us:<sup><a name="FN462A" id="FN462A"></a><a href=
  "#FN462">[462]</a></sup></p>

  <p>"It was a general surmise at least among the whole Order of Jesuits in foreign
  parts: or else one of them could hardly have stated the case so exactly some four or
  five years before it broke out. Father Del-Rio, in a treatise printed An. 1600, put the
  case, as if he had already looked into the Mine and Cellars, and had surveyed the
  barrels of powder in them, and had heard the whole confessions of Faux and
  Catesby."</p>

  <p>This "general surmise" does not appear to have been confined to the Jesuits
  themselves. Another ingenious writer, nearly a century earlier,<sup><a name="FN463A"
  id="FN463A"></a><a href="#FN463">[463]</a></sup> tells a wonderful story concerning the
  sermon of a Dominican, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg
  264]</a></span>preached in the same year, 1600, wherein it was related how there was a
  special hell, beneath the other, for Jesuits, so thick and fast did they arrive as to
  need extra accommodation. The preacher avowed that he had, in his vision of the place,
  given warning to the demon in charge of it, "to search them with speed, for fear that
  they had conveyed hither some gunpowder with them, for they are very skilfull in
  Mine-workes, and in blowing up of whole States and Parliament-houses, and if they can
  blow you all up, then the Spanyards will come and take your kingdom from you."</p>

  <p>Another notable specimen of the way in which reason and probability were cast to the
  winds is afforded by two letters written from Naples in 1610, one to King James and the
  other to Salisbury, by Sir Edwin Rich,<sup><a name="FN464A" id="FN464A"></a><a href=
  "#FN464">[464]</a></sup> who announced that Father Greenway&mdash;who of all the
  Jesuits was said to be most clearly convicted as a traitor&mdash;intended to send to
  the king a present of an embroidered satin doublet and hose, which, being craftily
  poisoned, would be death to him if he put them on.</p>

    <p class="ni"><sup><a name="FN459" id="FN459"></a><a href="#FN459A">[459]</a></sup>
    These instructions furnish an interesting specimen of the king's broad Scotch,

  <p class="center">IV.</p>

  <p>Besides the above there is a prolix description of the Plot, devised against the
  best of sovereigns, "a Jesuitis Romanensibus, perfidi&aelig; Catholic&aelig; et
  impietatis viperin&aelig; autoribus et assertoribus, aliisq. ejusdem amenti&aelig;
  scelerisq. patratoribus et sociis suscept&aelig;, et in ipso pestis derepente
  inferend&aelig; articulo (salutis anno 1605, mensis Novembris die quinto), tam
  pr&aelig;ter spem quam supra fidem mirifice et divinitus detect&aelig;."</p>

  <p>There is, moreover, a sentence in Hebrew, with Waad's cipher beneath, and a number
  of what seem to be meant for verses. The following lines are evidently the Lieutenant's
  description of his own office:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><small>"Custodis Custos sum, Carcer Carceris, arcis<br />
    <span class="c10">Arx, atque Argu' Argus; sum specul&aelig; specula;</span><br />
    Sum vinclum in vinclis; compes cum compede, clav<span class="c11">u</span><br />

    Dum regi regnoq. salus stet firma quieta,<br />
    <span class="c10">Splendida sim Compes Compedis usque licet."</span></small></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This is considerably more metrical and intelligible than some of the rest.</p>

  <p>In 1613 Waad was dismissed from his post, one of the charges against him being that
  he had embezzled the jewels of Arabella Stuart.<sup><a name="FN467A" id=
  "FN467A"></a><a href="#FN467">[467]</a></sup></p>

  <p>In Theobald's <i>Memoirs of Sir Walter Raleigh</i> (p. 16), Waad is described as
  "the Lieutenant of the Tower, and Cecil's great Creature."</p>

        <p><i>E.</i> As they were working upon the wall, they heard a rushing in a cellar
        of removing of coles; whereupon wee feared wee had been discovered, and they sent
        me to go to the cellar, who fynding that the coles were a selling, and that the
        Cellar was to be lett, viewing the commoditye thereof for our purpose, Percy went
        and hired the same for yearly Rent.</p>

        <p>Wee had before this provyded and brought into the house 20 barrells of Powder,
        which wee removed into the Cellar, and covered the same with billets and fagots,
        which we provided for that purpose.</p>
        <hr class='c14' />

        <p><i>F.</i> About Easter, the Parliament being proroged tyll October next, wee
        dispersed our selfs and I retired into the Low countryes, <i>by advice and

        <p>In the meane tyme Percy, having the key of the Cellar, layd in more powder and
        wood into it.</p>

        <p>I returned about the beginning of September next and then receyving the key
        againe of Percy, we brought in more powder and billets to cover the same

        returned agayne to the sayd Howse neare the cellar on Wednesday the 30 of

        <p>[He confesseth he was at the Erle of Montgomeryes marriage, but as he sayeth

        the same day that this detestable act should have been performed, the same day
        should other of their confederacye have surprised the person of the Lady
        Elizabeth, and presently have proclaimed her queen [to which purpose a
        Proclamation was drawne, as well to avowe and justify the Action, as to have
        protested against the Union, and in no sort to have meddeled with Religion
        therein. And would have protested all soe agaynst all strangers] and this
        proclamation should have been made in the name of the Lady Elizabeth.</p>
